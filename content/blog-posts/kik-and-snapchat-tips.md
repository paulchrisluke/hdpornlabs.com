## Kik

_This section was largely written by_ [_/u/califortunathrowaway_](https://old.reddit.com/u/califortunathrowaway)

Kik is an texting/SMS replacement application that is available for both Android and iOS. It allows people to have the texting/SMS experience without actually needing to pay for SMS messages and without sharing identifying information like real phone numbers. It is available on both the Google Play store and the Apple App Store. Once installed, Kik’s interface should look quite familiar to anybody who has used a text messaging app on a modern smart phone.

When we sell Kik sessions, we are typically arranging a period of time during which we will sext with the buyer and send them photos and/or videos. Kik sexting generally refers to short sessions (under 90 minutes) where the seller is giving the buyer her full attention. GFE, the Girlfriend Experience, is generally done in large part over kik, but takes place over a longer period of time, such as a few days or a week. In GFE sessions, the communication is more intermittent, much like the level of communication one would have with a significant other.

### Tips

* You can sell kik sessions any way that you would like, but over the years, certain conventions have come into existence in the reddit selling communities. You do not need to follow them, but many buyers will expect that you are following these conventions unless you specify otherwise. Be aware of what these conventions are so that you can make sure you communicate effectively with your buyers about what you are and aren’t providing. Transactions always go smoother when everyone is on the same page.
* Typically during a kik sexting session, buyers expect that they'll be receiving one on one time and your undivided attention. This is generally reflected in the pricing. If you are selling something different, you should communicate that to your buyers.
* During longer arrangements like GFEs, you are not expected to be instantly available nor to only be doing one session at a time.
* Buyers generally expect to receive nude photos during kik sessions. Clarify in your ads if you are not including photos/videos or if you are not willing to appear fully nude. This can be taken for granted by buyers who are used to receiving both nudity and photos/video with their sessions, to avoid misunderstandings, specify what your sessions include.
* If you are sending photos, you should also clarify whether you will be sending pre-existing photos from your gallery or live photos. If you are taking live photos, the buyers will probably make requests. Get an idea of what buyers enjoy seeing and their special requests before accepting payment, do not feel obligated to do something you are uncomfortable with if it was not agreed on beforehand.
* Showing face is not automatically expected. Some sellers show below the neck. Some show below the nose. Some show face only in pics that aren't nude. Some sellers show full face. As with everything else, it's best to clarify. Some sellers charge extra for face.
* Videos are not automatically expected. Some sellers send them. Some don't. If you do, it can be seen as a plus to buyers. Some sellers charge extra for videos.
* Dirty texting is often expected as a constant throughout the session rather than platonic chatting. Requests can range from roleplay scenarios, to specific fetishes, to general flirting. Ask what your buyers would like to experience first.
* Some buyers will try to turn kik sessions into modeling sessions by requesting photo after photo after photo. If this is something you're not interested in, you can state in your ads that you'll only send a certain number of photos during the session (like 8-15).
* Remember that kik sessions take longer than the time you spend actually doing the session. It takes time to make arrangements with the buyer, get ready and then clean up afterward. Charge for your time accordingly, many sellers have fees for fetish sessions.
