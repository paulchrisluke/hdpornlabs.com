# 1. Research & Safety

Camming is an industry that is often misunderstood - People see it as quick, easy money, often with minimal consequences. Understanding the industry, knowing the work it involves, and assessing the risks are all very important steps to take before deciding whether or not it is for you.

# 2. Electronic Equipment

In order to maximize your appeal, you have to make sure you look good! This means having:

* Good Lighting: options include soft boxes, umbrella lights, or regular lamps
* HD Webcam: the most popular/recommended is the Logitech C920 but preferably anything at least 720p HD ideally 1080p
* Fast Computer: i7 processor preferred, dual core processor (quad core is better) - you can build your own computer customized for camming for much cheaper than store bought, check out[/r/buildapc](https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapc) to learn more
* Fast Internet Connection: always use ethernet when you can, upload speed is more important for camming than download

Viewers love watching performers whose cams look crisp and clear!

# 3. Online Identity

If you are new to camming, you may not even know what all of your limits will be until you encounter someone requesting it. Therefore it's best to decide beforehand what yours are. You may decide that you will only get naked in paid chat, this is a common limit. Some other common limits are:

* Showing specific body parts such as feet, ass, or stomach.
* Anal (toy insertion, fingers, anything to do with it)
* Domination
* C2C (Cam-to-Cam, viewing a member's webcam)
* Moaning a member's name
* Giving out your location (not advised)
* Dirty talk
* Certain taboo roleplay scenarios such as incest, racial, rape, etc.
* Not doing custom content
* Not doing Skype sessions

Your limits may change over time and there is nothing wrong with suddenly deciding you are not okay with something you've offered before, or deciding to do something you refused before.

# 4. Taxes

Since joining this industry, it has been widely observed that many performers seem to believe they are somehow magically exempt from taxes. As much as we wish this were true, it is not.
