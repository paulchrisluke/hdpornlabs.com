_DISCLAIMER: I am not an accountant, and I may not be held responsible for your tax-related decisions. This post is made to provide insight and create discussion. Any official decisions made regarding how you handle your income taxes are between you and your accountant._

Taxes are something that I often see overlooked in this line of work. They are definitely important, as the money we make selling camshows, videos, pictures, fetish items and other adult services are earnings and should be claimed. Not claiming your taxes could end very poorly if you were ever to get audited, and bringing in a lot of money without claiming it is like painting a big target on your back.

Typically when claiming your earnings, you will claim them as one of two things: An independent contractor, or a small business owner. I'm going to emphasize this a lot throughout this post - **be sure to consult an accountant in your area to find out exactly what applies to you.**

Taxes and protocol for claiming earnings vary based on location, so **be sure to consult an accountant in your area to find out exactly what applies to you.** Most of what I will be covering in my post is based on my personal experience as a Canadian, and even then I have Canadian friends who claim things differently based on the advice of their own accountants. If anyone has any input based on their location (for example some places are stricter about tax deductibles than others) please let us know.

**Things to take into consideration:**

Taxes are not automatically deducted from your earnings, even if you operate on sites outside of Reddit that handle payments. This means you are responsible for putting aside a % of all your earnings so that you can pay your taxes at the end of the year. Tax rates vary based on location, so **be sure to consult an accountant in your area to find out exactly what applies to you.**

***

Job-related expenses are often tax-deductible. Keep all receipts, as well as a record of your expenses.

_Potential_ tax-deductibles are:

* Toys/lube
* Lingerie/outfits/shoes (items you purchase with the intention of selling and/or wearing in shows/videos)
* Computer equipment (work computer, webcam, monitor, battery back-up, etc)
* Cosmetics/beauty services (tanning, hair, nails, waxing, etc)
* Office space. This only applies if you have a room specifically set up for work. If you cam out of your bedroom, it cannot be claimed. I live in a two bedroom apartment, and my second bedroom is my office. To calculate the value of my office space, I measured the size of my apartment, and divided it by the cost of my apartment (not including the cost of extras such as hydro, which is paid separately) to get the cost per square foot. I measured my office space and calculated the square footage, then multiplied it by the price per square foot to find out the value of my office space. That value is tax deductible.
* Office furniture
* Internet bill
* Phone bill (if you offer phone sex services)
* Envelopes/cost of shipping, for mailable goods.
* Mileage to pick up work-related items
* Customs charges for work-related items purchased online

***

Any expense that is split between personal and business use cannot _fully_ be deducted. For example, I use the internet and my phone for business and personal purposes, so I only deduct a portion of each of those bills. Depending on where you live, you may not be allowed to deduct certain things at all. I know this is overkill, but I'm going to say it again: **be sure to consult an accountant in your area to find out exactly what applies to you.**
