First and foremost, learn how to use Reddit if you are completely new to Reddit in general. Most people use [http://imgur.com/](http://imgur.com/ "http://imgur.com/") to post links to photos and then put their prices in the comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/comments/3fincu/snp_snap_sell_today_only_get_my_snaps_daily_for/). Learn how formatting works. You can find info on formatting [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting). Use formatting to help make your comments stand out. A good tool to download is [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/). RES is a great way to get instant notifications when you have a message, the never ending front page is awesome, and there's a ton of other sweet little things it does to make selling all around easier. By no means is it difficult to get started selling your products on Reddit. However, this page should cover everything you need to know to create great listings and use the communities on Reddit to meet great buyers.

## Posting a Listing

### Where to Post

For a full list of the subreddits where selling is allowed and encouraged, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sellercirclestage/w/sellingsubs). Be sure the item or service you're selling is allowed in the subreddits you choose.

**Cross-Posting**

Cross-posting, or x-posting, means posting the same listing in 2 or more separate subreddits. It is encouraged on every selling subreddit and you are not required to state that the listing is a cross-post. This is a great way to get more exposure for your items/services and reach as many buyers as possible.

### What to Include

There are a couple things that you should always include in a listing, like a photo and a price, but the following is a full list of suggested items to include. Having to answer fewer and fewer questions over PMs because your listings contain the important information, means making more successful sales (almost guaranteed!).

_Some subreddits have rules stating you have to include some of these items, check each subreddit's sidebar for their list of policies and rules before posting._

* A photo of the item or service for sale OR a photo of you
* A description of the item or service for sale
* A description of you
* Your price
* Your limits or what you do and do not do for buyers. May include things like vomit, blood, urine, crushing, and so on.
* Your payment methods ([click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sellercirclestage/w/paymentmethods) for a list of the most popular ones used by sellers)
* Amount of time it will take to complete/ship an order
* Items included with the purchase (shipping costs, photo album, access to a private subreddit, etc.)
* The quality of your equipment (camera, webcam, etc)

Never copy your listings from other sellers and always find ways to highlight what's awesome and unique about you and your services.

### Markdown and Formatting

Reddit uses Markdown for comments and posts as a way to introduce formatting. [Click here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting) for everything you need to know to create bold, italics, line breaks, headers, tables, and more!

## Tools

The following are some tools and tricks we've found for making the experience of selling on Reddit a little easier.

### Moderator Toolbox

The 'Moderator Toolbox' extension was created to make Reddit easier to use for moderators. However, it has a few features that are useful whether you moderate or not.

* Create and save notes about buyers/users (kinks they like, problems they gave you, and so on)
* Receive a notification when a new message is received without having to refresh the page
* Save bookmarks to a toolbar at the bottom of the screen and have easy access to things like Gift Card payment pages, your albums of available items, and so on.

To download, visit [/r/toolbox](https://old.reddit.com/r/toolbox).

### Mobile Apps

Using mobile apps will keep you notified of potential sales via PM when you're on the go. Time is money and sometimes waiting too long to respond to a buyer can mean a lost sale when their whim to purchase has passed.

**Popular Reddit Apps**

* Alien Blue *_Official Reddit App_
* Bacon Reader
* RedditIsFun

### Reddit Preferences

The following are preferences attached to your reddit account which, when changed, benefit sellers. [Click here](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) to begin editing your preferences.

**Messaging Options**

* Uncheck "mark messages as read when I open my inbox" to better organize your inbox. With this box checked, checking your inbox will mark every item as read and remove them from new messages. With this box unchecked, you will click on a message when checking your inbox to mark it as read and remove it from new messages. Helps with saving and sorting your messages so that old messages you still need to address don't get buried.

**Privacy Options**

* Make sure the box titled "don't allow search engines to index my user profile" is checked. This prevents search engines from indexing (aka saving forever) the information found on your user page.

## Posting on Gonewild Subreddits

The majority of GoneWild subreddits are open to having sellers post their photos. However, the majority of GW subreddits are NOT open to having sellers use their GW posts to advertise their products and services. Used wisely, posting on GoneWild subreddits can be a fun way to meet fans and create future buyers. Keep in mind...

* Do not post on [/r/GoneWild](https://old.reddit.com/r/GoneWild) or [/r/treesgonewild](https://old.reddit.com/r/treesgonewild) with your selling account. They have a bot that removes posts from users with submissions in selling subreddits. Create a separate account if you wish to use these 2 subreddits.
* Do not post your selling photos and albums on GW subreddits. Create original content for your GW submissions.
* Do not respond to PMs received due to a GW post with information about your selling unless they specifically mention something relevant like how much they love your panties or how badly they want to kik with you. Spending money is not why the user browsed GW and messaged you. Responding with selling information is guaranteed to anger/annoy at least one user enough to report you to the moderators.

## Starting Your Own Subreddit

A great way to keep your fans interested and updated on all your new content is to create and maintain your very own subreddit. It's very easy and recommended even if you want to keep it private and invite your favorite buyers and fans.

**Step 1 - Create the Subreddit**

Use [this link](http://www.reddit.com/subreddits/create) to create your subreddit. Use your username or a variation of it as the subreddit name and look carefully at each setting before saving.

**Step 2 - Make It Pretty** _optional_

CSS is the term for code that alters the appearance of your subreddit. You can copy and paste some templates, like [/r/mindashq](https://old.reddit.com/r/mindashq) and [/r/naut](https://old.reddit.com/r/naut), or create your own from scratch. If you have any questions or need help with your css, the folks at [/r/csshelp](https://old.reddit.com/r/csshelp) are always helpful!

**Step 3 - Post Content**

Create original content or cross-post your listings and gonewild submissions. The more you post the better the community. Many sellers offer exclusive listings and discounts to their subscribers to keep them visiting the page for more.
