Not everyone you encounter in your selling will have the best of intentions. These are the most common scams and advice for how to avoid having them successfully used on you. For all of our tips on Safety and Privacy, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sellercirclestage/w/safety).

## Cancelling Payments

This happens when a buyer sends you a payment, receives your product or service, then cancels the payment and repossesses his funds. It is most often used with GiftRocket gift cards which take anywhere from hours to days to finalize and clear into your accounts depending on which method you've used to claim them.

You should **never** provide an item or service until your funds are definitively in your accounts and belong to you. If you must, only offer exceptions to buyers that you have worked with in the past and trust.

For a list of pros and cons of various payment methods, including information about which methods provide instantly available funds to you, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sellercirclestage/w/paymentmethods). The most popular alternative to GiftRocket is Amazon which finalizes instantly when redeemed and Bitcoin.

## Providing Fraudulent GiftCard Codes

This happens when a buyer insists that he is unable to purchase a giftcard through 'regular' means (providing an official e-mail from the giftcard provider to your inbox) and must e-mail or PM you the code to the giftcard instead. In some cases, the buyer can report the code as stolen or the giftcard as fraudulently purchased raising suspicions about you and the validity of your accounts.

You should only redeem cards that have been purchased from the official retailers website and sent directly to your e-mail. Amazon gift cards are available for purchase internationally and can be sent to you even if you are located in a different country as the buyer.

## Fishing for Free Content

This scam takes many shapes and forms. Some users will PM you to discuss the gritty details of their order, getting off to the discussion of your service rather than paying for it. You may be contacted by users who demand that you prove your trustworthiness to them by sending them nude or very specific 'verification photos'. Other buyers have been known to place an order and then refuse to send payment until they see 'previews' of the item or service so they know what they're getting.

Always ask for full payment _before_ beginning to work on or delivering a product. If a buyer needs your verification, send them clothed photos or obtain your official verification from your selling subreddit of choice.

## New Websites Looking to Recruit

You will receive PMs from new or established websites that are looking to recruit new models, pantysellers, cam girls, etc. While some of these PMs will be legitimate, the vast majority will not be. Real established websites will most likely not be contacting you via Reddit PM to recruit you.

Do not offer any personal information or samples of your work or services until you've verified that the business contacting you is legitimate. Refrain from clicking on links sent to you via PM as they may be used to obtain your IP address and attempt to blackmail or stalk you. Message the moderators of the sub they found you on or message Reddit admins directly at [/r/reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit.com) to report spam and attempts to take advantage of you.

## IP Fishing

This was just mentioned briefly but it entails a person attempting to gather your IP information in order to blackmail or stalk you. There are a number of ways that this can be done. The most important thing to know is that every website you visit is able to see your IP information unless you are using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to cloak your IP.

Do not click on any suspicious links in PMs. If you hover over a link and the script doesn't show that it leads to a site that you know and trust, do not click it. If a user attempts to have you fill out a survey, do not fill it out for them. If a user attempts to have you log into their Bitcoin wallet, do not do it. These are all ways that users have attempted to fish IP addresses with. If you are able to use a VPN, please do.

## Faked Blackmail

_First, if anyone is attempting to blackmail you, real or fake, report them to Reddit admins and the Internet Crime Complaint Center if you're comfortable giving your information to law enforcement._

This scam is an old one that currently resurfaced. A user sends you a message telling you they've found your Facebook account or other personal information like IP address. They tell you they are going to tell/show your friends and family your photos if you don't respond and give them x, y, and z. This message may have a link in it that leads to your Facebook profile. This link will take any person to the Facebook page they are currently logged in as. If you are not logged into your Facebook profile, this link will take you to the Facebook home page.

Do not respond to threats. Contact Reddit admins and check the links in the message **without clicking on them** to see if they lead to suspicious websites or to faked personal information. Be vigilant, blackmail can take many forms. For tips on keeping your identity safe, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sellercirclestage/w/safety).

## Buyers Uploading/Profiting from Your Work

Unfortunately, our buyers aren't always as trustworthy as we'd like them to be. You should be searching the internet regularly for your username and aliases and reverse image searching your photos to see if your content is being shared without your consent. It is inevitable that any photos you post publicly will be linked to all over the internet. However, it is not an accepted or condoned practice to share the images and videos you are selling privately.

Watermark your content if you are comfortable with your reddit name travelling around the internet. Include a basic disclaimer in listings or as an attachment about your ownership of the product.
