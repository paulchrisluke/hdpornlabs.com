# I. Introduction and Basics

## Big Misconceptions

**Self Publishing Erotica is a get rich quick scheme.**

Nope. This is absolutely an industry that takes work, and thanks to a certain book that caused an explosion in the erotica industry (50 Shades of Gray), it's even harder now. You are virtually invisible unless you have 30 titles under your belt. Anybody can do it, but it is absolutely a greater reward over time kind of job.

**I can't write, I'll never make it.**

This industry is about 90% marketing and 10% writing. And and and you've got one of the biggest advertising boons on your side: you already have a fan base. The more you write the better you will become anyways, you're always growing, so don't use that as an excuse.

**You can only write about what you love or have experienced.**

And this idea isn't limited to writing erotica. If people only wrote about stuff they've actually experienced, we wouldn't have genres like fantasy. By the same token, if you write hot books about girls getting double-teamed, kidnapped and role playing rape scenarios or even incest, it does not mean that you yourself have to be into those things, the same way you wouldn't assume a murder mystery author enjoys killing people.

**It won't make money.**

This misconception comes from the idea that there is so much for free available online. I don't know the exact reason why, but it most certainly does rake in the cash. While there are free places such as Literotica, perhaps it's the prestige generally associated with an actual book, perhaps its the branding (your pen name) or the organization of an actual book retailer that separates us. Whatever it is, it works.

**Erotica is just porn.**

There is a huge difference between the two, and that difference is: erotica is personal. Just like the difference between reading a book and watching its movie counterpart. Your brain makes all of the connections, paints the perfect pictures in your head when you read the book. The movie is just another person's image being presented to you. Self insertion and a fantasy is what you're selling.

## Composition of an Erotic Short Story

The ideal erotic short is between 3,000-7,000 words and may be broken up like such:

* 1,000-2,500 words establishment
* 1,000-2,000 words sex scene
* 1,000- 2,500 words closing

**Establishment** is the setting, "plot," introduction of the characters, things of that nature. You may want to include a teasing/masturbation type scene to keep the reader enticed.

**Sex Scene** is exactly what it sounds like. I suspect some of you have written sex scenes to sell via [r/fetishitems](https://old.reddit.com/r/fetishitems) or for commissions. If you have trouble pushing this to meet 1,000 words, focus on the 5 senses and remember that you have 2 (or more) characters you can focus on as well as a selling idea- a kink, a fetish that your characters can think about.

**Closing** is the conclusion and you should always include a set up for a sequel in case the book does well so it's not like you're pulling a new plot totally out of your butt. Unlike romance, the ending to an erotica short does not have to be happy. Although, if you forget this step and don't forget to set something up for a sequel, it's not the end of the world.

### Key Components

Your book needs to have a kink or fetish, and remember that just because something sounds awesome to do in person doesn't mean it will translate well on paper.

Good kink example: being kidnapped and bred by a minotaur.

Bad kink example: that one time you had sex in blacklight with your fuck buddy.

Good kink example: first time having sex.

Bad kink example: that time you had sex with this guy you really liked.

Each good example has some fantastical element about it. The magic of that first time. The raw power of a mythical creature having his way with some damsel in distress. The bad examples may be great for reality-- snagging that high school hottie probably did wonders for your ego-- but that's better suited for longer pieces where we get more time to fall in love with the characters than an erotic short story.

Role play scenarios apply as "kinks" as well. Boss x secretary, doctor x patient or nurse, professor x student... those are about as fantasy-based as it comes. BDSM, tentacle monsters, lactation, breeding, exhibitionism, sex slaves, mythical monsters, pony play, gangbangs...

**Perspective** is something to consider, too. If you're writing something with more than 2 characters (threesomes, gangbangs) I recommend 1st person because it's easier to keep track of all those limbs and flopping penises. For Dom/sub types, go 1st person (I/me) from the sub's perspective, since part of the nature of the dom is his/her mystery (if you want money I highly recommend going male dominant, though, if you choose to connect this work with your pen name, you may be able to carve out a femdom niche for yourself.) 3rd person (she/he/it, character names) are best for two-person interactions.

Avoid 2nd person (you). This is the perspective we get a lot in bad erotica mail (_"I lay you down and eat your pussy until you're crying out and your juices are leaking all over my face."_) and it comes off as controlling and just weird and turns off a lot of readers. The only time you should consider 2nd person writing is if you're doing a Create Your Own Adventure erotica.

### Illegal Content

There are certain kinks and fetishes you cannot publish, including:

Bestiality (animals that occur naturally; mythical creatures are okay to write about)

Underage (no characters under 18, nor can the character seem to allude to underage, including still living with parents or being in high school)

### Frowned Upon/Taboo Content

These are the kinks that make the retailers a lot of money, that readers love, but the morality police can't stand so we have to deal with backlashes in public opinion occasionally. You CAN write about these but you must practice caution in their appearance:

* "Barely" legal content. Babysitters, Cheerleaders, _anyone_ in high school. Anything that markets the female in the story as freshly ripe for the ~~p~~dickin's.
* Incest. We get around this by something called pseudo-cest or, step or adoptive sex. Mention the actual relationship once in the beginning, ("He adopted me/ She's only my step mom") and then let the "oh daddy!"s fly. You cannot allude to, mention, or _have_ the sexy couple be(ing) blood related. To market these books you can use words like "Taboo" or "Home" in your descriptions and titles. Just avoid family terms (Mother, son, daughter, daddy) in your titles and descriptions. Your book may get banned, or put behind an adult filter if you do, which kills your visibility, and thus makes it harder to sell.
* Forced/"Raped"/Kidnapped/dubcon/noncon: Any hardcore content you write risks a backlash. A lot of writers get around that by tacking on a bit to the ending that announces the whole scenario was planned from the beginning, or it was okay because the sub enjoyed herself. Avoid the words "reluctant/forced/against her will" in your descriptions and titles.

# II. Formatting and Writing Your Ebook

## Formatting

Whether you use Microsoft word or Open office, all of your books have to be formatted a specific way because otherwise it will look all wonky when it gets converted to .epub and .mobi and all those other file types you need to read on eReader devices.

I'll start with the short version, before going into the details just so you have a basic/general idea.

Before the body of the book (the part where you type the story) you will need:

* Center alignment
* Title page: includes title and your author name
* Copyright info
* Disclaimer

For the body, actual book part, you want:

* First line indent by .5
* single space
* right alignment

After the body:

* center alignment
* excerpts
* about the author
* "back matter" and hyperlinks

**Font & Misc**: any easy to read font, between 9-12 points is recommended. Do NOT use the tab key. Do NOT use the "enter" key to skip pages, use ctrl + enter to insert page breaks when needed.

I recommend setting up a document as a template that you can save and open with each new title, using things like TITLE HERE to set up placement spots.

**Copyright Info** reads as such:

First line: "Published by YOUR NAME HERE 2014"

Second line: "Copyright YOUR NAME HERE 2014"

**Disclaimer** This is becoming more and more mandatory for erotica, so I recommend putting it in regardless just because it will make things easier:

"All depicted characters are 18 years or older."

For Amazon/et al, you will need a more elaborate disclaimer if you are writing taboo content, that I will cover here in just a minute. But this just basically covers your ass that no, this is not underage porn.

**Excerpts** are just what they sound like: enticing snippets of other books you've written and published. Only use about 2 or 3 per book, and keep them as either your best selling books and/or books with similar themes/kinks/fetishes.

**About the Author and Backmatter** You want to write an enticing paragraph about yourself or your pen name and include hyperlinks to your author pages. You want to make it as easy as possible for interested parties to buy the books, especially after you just got them all hot and bothered again with the excerpts. You can set up a hyperlink by highlighting the text you want to link up and clicking on "edit hyperlink." I will go over making author pages/profiles etc. when I go over the various distributors and retail sites.

## Writing Your Ebook

You get a whole lot of freedom with this, despite my previous chapter warning you about illegal and taboo content. The inside of your book is incredibly safe, as long as you don't flirt too much with the danger line-- don't worry, I'll guide you through, and they're really not that bad anyways.

For **barely legal** esque content, your biggest concern is making your characters of legal age, and appearing of legal age. A rule of thumb we use for this is to avoid having characters in high school, or characters who still live with their parents. Again, yes, you can still be 18 and in high school, everyone knows this, but ultimately, **it will look bad, and reflect badly upon you if a customer chooses to take it the wrong way** so the guideline is: college, and visiting home for a holiday if it's incestuous.

For **rape fantasies/dub-con/non-consent** content your biggest concern is going to be making it NOT outright rape. This means the sub or "victim" has to enjoy and want the punishment herself one way or another. You may choose to have the captor resist verbally, but write how internally she consents or wants it, but some people have issues with this because of Stockholm syndrome, where a captor becomes empathetic to his/her captor. Other things you can do is go through the scene, then reveal how the whole scene was a couple role playing the woman's fantasy. You **must**, for all of the major retailers, have some kind of buffer like my examples to show the sex was, in fact, consensual and that both characters enjoyed themselves. Otherwise you risk having your author account banned, angering your reader base and all kinds of other scary things.

The difference between nonconsent and dubious consent- or, dubcon and noncon:

* Nonconsent is pretty much just that: rape. Outright "no, god, stop" and someone straight up not listening. You can't write and publish that-- unless you reveal it was consensual at the end via rape role play or something.
* Dubious Consent: Reluctant consent. "Suck my dick or I'm going to kill you," "suck my dick or I'm going to fire you," Where the captive or sub consents because the alternative is worse. You can write dubcon with more acceptance than you can write noncon, generally speaking, as long as both parties enjoy it.

For **incest** you can't actually write incest erotica on the biggest retailers- Amazon and Apple- so we get around it by doing step-incest, fostering, adoptive, and other alternative-family options, and labeling it as "taboo." On the smaller-big retailers (Barnes and Noble, Smashwords) you can technically do real incest but it (honestly) is a bitch to keep up with between updates, editing, and trying not to get caught and in trouble by the other distributors that frankly, it's just not worth it. In my opinion.

## Elaborate Disclaimers

For Amazon (and really, all of your distributors) it is considered a service and polite to include a list of sexual acts in the book that some readers may not like or find otherwise objectionable. This is particularly true for the "frowned upon" kinks and fetishes of incest, or forced/kidnapping books, but you want to make it sound fun and sexy, not scary or too technical. Here is an example of an elaborate disclaimer:

_This book contains explicit sex scenes between a strict daddy and his naughty step-daughter, including but not limited to first time anal sex and some BDSM elements that some readers may find offensive. Enjoy!_

This way when a potential reader checks out the sample, s/he can determine if step-cest is something s/he's into and then either buy or purchase something else. This is good because it will prevent an angry backlash if the reader feels your blurb or book description was misleading, and also, it generally sucks if you think you're getting a book with a certain kink and then boom, it isn't, and turns out to be something you're generally disturbed by.

Elaborate disclaimers can go right below the copyright information that way they are easily seen when readers sample check your book.

## Characters and Plot

**Characters:** A huge part of erotica is self-insertion, so generally you don't want to get hung up on physical details- blonde hair, blue eyes, etc- because they can actually distract and knock someone out of their fantasy of a brown haired brown eyed cutie or whatever. I mention the physical details once or twice during the establishment scenes and not at all during the actual sex scene.

**Plot:** haha. For short erotic fiction the plot is whatever set up you need to get the two people (or more) to have sex. Secretary is about to lose her job. College student is about to fail. Daddy's little girl needs to apologize for doing something naughty. Only girl on the soccer team is a wimp and the team needs to toughen her up by filling her with dicks. (Yay porn logic!) A mysterious lollipop that switches your sex for you. Aliens from outer space need women to breed to repopulate their planets. Trapped in a labyrinth with a sex-starved minotaur. Streaking down a mountain with your boyfriend when you suddenly find out his big secret: he's a werewolf. You get the idea.

# III. Marketing and Selling Your Ebook

The 3 most important parts of your Ebook, in order, are...

* The Cover
* The Description
* The Backmatter

These are your 3 biggest and most important marketing tools. The cover is the first thing someone will see, it has to be both catchy and informative. After you catch their eye with the cover, give them more information with the description and secure that sale, after they've read it, tell them where they can get more. That is the core business plan.

## Covers

When you're starting out, I do not advise dropping a bunch of money on a professionally done cover unless you have some serious financial stability. I have said this before and I will say it again: **you are virtually invisible in the erotica market until you have at least 30 titles under your pen name.** You want to be certain that this is something you like doing and can do and will continue to do and can turn a profit on before you start throwing money at elaborate covers. Books can still sell with shitty covers, I've seen it happen, my first covers were horrible headless cut out lingerie models on solid color background with the titles and my author name written in comic sans. No, I am not kidding. I wish I was.

You will always be able to change the book covers, so don't get in a horrible rut about them when you're starting out. But, a good cover doesn't have to be elaborate or contain a lot of graphic designs, you can make a decent placeholder or even great one yourself and then decide later if a more professional one is right for you.

### How to Make a Cover

All you need is:

* A basic photo manipulator program like Gimp or PhotoShop
* Access to a stock photo website

Stock photos are pictures that photographers sell for people to use for things like advertising, book covers, web sites, etc. They do cost money, but most places use a credit system so there is no direct conversion rate, usually you can buy them in bulk for cheaper kind of deal, and I do recommend doing that. As long as you're not printing copies of your book, you don't have to worry about extended licensing. Keep a record of all the stock photos you buy because if you lose them after a certain amount of time, even with an account, they will usually make you repurchase them. Most stock photo sites have an "email me the photo" option too so you'll always have on in your email just in case.

Believe it or not, there is sort of an unspoken code about what goes into a book cover, so you can communicate to seasoned readers what to expect in the book, all based on the models, setting, font and color choice.

Use male models for gay erotica. Couples or women are suitable for straight erotica. A solo woman or a couple of women are suitable for lesbian erotica. Pretty straight forward.

Any type of role playing coupling like nuns, college girls, etc you can have a good bit of luck for when searching for stock photos. Just search for "sexy nuns" or "school girl skirt" and you'll get a lot of options. Of course the more popular the "outfit" the more results you'll get. The same advice for BDSM and bondage. This is what I mean by having an "informative" cover. You can also pick a complimenting font type for the text on the cover.

But you might not have a lot of luck looking for an image that fits your kink. Say you're writing about some poor girl who gets sold to a centaur king for breeding purposes. Any images you're likely to find on a stock photo site of a centaur are probably going to be... scary. For mythical creature-related word porn we try to communicate via a setting. Usually the jungle or outdoors. If you're writing werewolf or shifter erotica, use a full moon somewhere on your cover. For tentacles, generally octopus or really well done graphic tentacles can work.

**Sizes you will need (in pixels):**

* A full 2400x1600
* A medium 1500x1000
* A small 300x200

### Cover Tips

* When purchasing stock photos, go with as close to the largest size as you can (2400x1600). When in doubt, go bigger, it's easier to shrink than to blow up an image.
* The title of your book is more important than your name. Make the title big and readable in thumbnail size, and your name take up as little space as possible while still contributing to a nice cover.
* If you can find a whole image to use for your cover: awesome. But in the offchance you can't, cutting out a model from one and pasting her onto a certain setting is always an option, too. Or hiring someone to make the cover for you is an option as well.
* I don't recommend using your own photos for your covers. When compared to other, stock-photo made erotica books they are identified almost immediately and are _generally_ less appealing. Though, using them could be an option for starting out when your covers aren't quite as important.

### Sources for Stock Photos and Fonts

**Stock Photos**

* You can find some free stock photos at [Dreamstime](http://www.dreamstime.com/free-images_pg1). These will be better for background and setting images than the sexy models, but hell, if you can find a free stock photo you think you'll be able to use, go ahead and grab it.
* [Canstock Photo](http://www.canstockphoto.com/) is actually my favorite place, they have great images and the price range is within my budget and they have some really great, high quality photos.
* [Deposit Photos](http://depositphotos.com/) is a little more expensive and runs on subscriptions, but is one many others recommend, and might work for you if you prefer to have a cover first and then write a book as the inspiration from the cover.
* [Erotic Stock Photos](http://eroticstockphotos.com/) was actually made by an erotica author who also has a flare for photography, and in the spirit of wanting to give back the community, s/he now takes photos for authors to use for their ebook covers, it is more expensive, but the photos are probably as specific as you're going to find for certain kinks and fetishes.

**Fonts**

* [Dafont](http://www.dafont.com/) has a whole shitton of fonts that are great. Just be sure you check the public and free to use options when searching. I also recommend plugging in the title of your book in the "sample text" box.
* [1001 Free Fonts](http://www.1001freefonts.com/) I don't actually use this place, but I've seen other people recommend it.
* [Font Space](http://www.fontspace.com/) A friend who makes my covers prefers this place, she says they're of a "higher quality" than other free fonts, but I've never detected much of a difference.

## Descriptions, Titles & Your Pen Name

In this chapter we will talk about your second most important marketing tool: your description, also commonly called "blurbs." I will also be chatting a bit about book titles and pen names.

### Descriptions

This is that little bit on the inside of a hardback book, or on the back of a paperback that briefly explains what's going on, and intrigues a reader to see what's inside. In the case of erotica, a description may extend to the inside copyright page of the ebook, in the form of the elaborate disclaimer that I previously discussed.

_tl;dr_: if your book contains any intense or particular sex act that you cannot indicate with a cover, title or in the public description, put it in the disclaimer.

A good book description is written in the same order as a book. It establishes the characters (by name) and important basic ideas first (setting, jobs, things like that), mentions the problem, may elaborate on why that problem is particularly bad, presents an open-ended set of conclusions for the reader to wonder what will happen.

Don't worry if you aren't totally pleased with how your blurbs are, just like covers and most other things, you can change them later when you get better. The most important part of this when starting is to just produce books.

I haven't had enough coffee, so I'm going to steal some blurbs from erotica authors to use as examples:

> Steven is a womaniser and a downright sleaze. He has three women on the go at once, and takes great delight in bragging about it around the office. But someone has around the office has a big mouth, and Steven soon learns that he's been messing with the wrong women. Powerful women - with unusual talents. His womanising days are about to come to an end - a sticky, wet and shameful end when Steven finds himself bent over the back of a couch, with his panties around his knees and his newly formed breasts bouncing...

* [Sticky Little Sissy by Alexa Chan](http://www.amazon.com/Sticky-Little-Sissy-Hardcore-Erotica-ebook/dp/B00IY1H3IO/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1YTTQRVA3FP4RTAZJCEK)

A little long, but it gets the point across: this is a book about gender swap and domination and sissification. In it we get a feel for the mood of the book and know the general path of what's going to happen on the inside.

> Secret agent Randal Blake has been captured by the enemy, soon to be tortured and held in captivity. Or so he thinks - until his captor makes it clear that he's interested in more than information or ransom. Bold and sensual, the mysterious kidnapper offers Blake a unique alternative to traditional torture. Will the straight spy decide to become another man's sex slave? Warning! This 9,000 word story contains kidnapping, bondage, caning, collaring, first-time anal sex, gunplay, and fisting. Adults only!

* [Bound by the Enemy by Jessi Bond](http://www.amazon.com/Bound-Enemy-Jessi-Bond-ebook/dp/B00AQQXPWS/ref=sr_1_8?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1399993979&sr=1-8&keywords=jessi+bond)

Description that's short, sweet and to the point and includes a list of sexual acts so readers know exactly what to expect. I know I mentioned putting this list on the inside in the elaborate disclaimer before, you only have to do that if it is something Amazon doesn't like, (see "Frowned Upon/Taboo Kinks" in Chapter 1). But ultimately, the choice is theirs about whether or not your blurb is "too adult." It's one of the pains of self publishing, so just write it and throw it up and wait for the email that says they don't like it.

In the event that you do have more information and taboo descriptions on the inside of the book, you want the reader to know, so you put something at the end of your blurb to direct them to the sample view, something like...

* "Story is so hot, so forbidden, so taboo that I can't even tell you their full names--click the cover to see story titles and descriptions."
* "Look inside the book to see the forbidden adventures that await!"
* "Click on the cover to take just a peek at the wild ride... if you dare."

If you need some blurb-spiration, just click through and read a bunch from other books that have the same fetish/kink/audience as your book.

### Titles

Just like everything else, information is key. A good title accompanies your cover and book to contribute to what the book is about.

If your cover image has lingerie-clad models, you don't really need to use explicit sexy words like "fuck" because it's obvious the book is erotica. Instead, pick another kink in the book to focus on to summarize the book.

Alternatively, if your book pretty much focuses on 1 kink, go ahead and ramp that up and make it obvious. My above advice is more appropriate when you're working with many, many kinks, or unusual erotica...

* [Abraham Lincoln: Fuck Lord of the Moon](http://www.amazon.com/Abraham-Lincoln-Fuck-Lord-Presidential-ebook/dp/B00BPF5MLG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1399995995&sr=1-1&keywords=abraham+lincoln+fuck+lord+of+the+moon)
* [Someone to Cuddle](http://www.amazon.com/Someone-Cuttle-Cuttlefish-Shapeshifter-Erotica-ebook/dp/B0087PTMW2/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1399996079&sr=1-2&keywords=someone+to+cuddle)
* [Nostril Fucked by the Micropenis](http://www.amazon.com/Nostril-Fucked-Micropenis-Fannie-Tucker-ebook/dp/B009QFSNS6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1399996155&sr=1-1&keywords=nostril+fucked+by+the+micropenis)
* [She Pegged an Alpha and He Liked It](http://www.amazon.com/She-Pegged-Alpha-He-Liked-ebook/dp/B00EBVCGJC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1399996215&sr=1-1&keywords=she+pegged+an+alpha+and+he+liked+it)

Use your titles and covers and descriptions together to present your work as it is. Most of these are non-serious erotica books, because sometimes you just need to have fun at work and a lot of these were written as jokes to let off steam. But the point remains.

**Oh god, titles suck, I can't think of anything.**

Here I come to save the day with the solid staple title! You really can't go wrong with this title, unless Amazon doesn't like it (another one of those things you can't do much to help, sadly), if you can't think of anything clever...

* \[VERB\]'ed by the \[BLANK\]

Adjust the middle "by the" as necessary for grammar. For example, "Blackmailed by my Professor," "Bound by the Enemy," "My Best Friend's Pussy"

You really can't go wrong. Don't worry about someone else having a title like this, they are essentially stock. Don't steal someone else's clever title though, like Gender Swap Lollipop is pretty exclusive to Raminar Dixon, and if you use it you're going to look like a stealing cuntbucket. But for generic titles like the ones above, it's not a big deal.

... Unless it's something outrageously specific, like "Anally ravished for the first time by my billionaire half-minotaur, half-tentacle monster step-daddy"

### Your Pen Name

I cannot stress how strongly I advise that you not use your real name to publish erotica. It could actually end up a whole lot worse than using PayPal to get paid for the work we do here. Because when you sign up as an author you give the distributors _everything_-- your SSN, your legal address, your name. Having a pen name adds a layer of security to protect you from the public.

I have heard horrible, awful horror stories of people who write erotica getting blackmailed by people who found out their real names, getting disowned by their families, divorced, fired from their every day jobs, harassed on FB by people who find out their real names... the world is full of morality police and some serious cray cray bitches.

For the love of god, Buddha, Odin, Thor, Zeus, Aphrodite, Allah, fate, karma, yourself, whoever your deity is, please **do not publish erotica under your real name**.

It's not about privacy it's about your safety.

I've gotten fan mail where a "fan" told me he would kidnap and rape me just like characters X and Y did to character Z in a book (didn't mention that character Z and X were a couple role playing out a rape fantasy that Z had, but doesn't matter, fantasy-rape) if he found out my address.

So, please. Just use that extra layer of protection to save yourself from the crazies. Yes, they can still technically find out your real info, but it takes a lot of effort on their part, and if they do you can report them to whoever (whichever medium they're harassing you on) and you can say your identity is private and they can handle it by banning the person or whatever. You can't do that if you publish under your real name, cause you're volunteering that information.

Enough fear mongering.

I know most of us here (...) are females, women, womyn, pick your favorite label, which is good cause on average female names sell better than male names.

Make it a real-sounding name. Yes, you probably want to cross-advertise for your fans here but you're also appealing to a whole new array of people, and those readers like books from other "real" people. Though most of them know we're personas at this point, it's easier to imagine we're people if we have real-sounding names.

You can still allude to your username somehow, or if you've already picked a real-fake-name to associate with your reddit persona. I have one, it's Clara Hunt, and that's the name I'll be publishing under. But your name doesn't have to BE only realistic, it just has to take the form of a realistic name-- first and last name, maybe a middle initial. You can play with them still.

I'll pull some random girls and offer suggestions to better explain what I mean:

[/u/leeloospanties](https://old.reddit.com/u/leeloospanties)[ ](javascript:void 0 "set a tag")you can probably use "leeloo" as your name, it's cute and identifiable. Might adjust it to like Leigh Lou or something like that to make it more realistic but it's still ... leeloo.

[/u/caitekitty](https://old.reddit.com/u/caitekitty)[ ](javascript:void 0 "set a tag")could probably use Caite as a first name, and some cat-esque last name.

[/u/minxhibitionist](https://old.reddit.com/u/minxhibitionist)[ ](javascript:void 0 "set a tag")could probably incorporate "minx" as a first or last name. Minx Hibition.

Some of my favorite pen names are puzzles or words:

Raminar Dixon. (say it slowly)

Naomi Lauder ("i moan louder")

Mike Hunt (of course)

Alternatively if you want to use a more realistic sounding pen name, there are several options for you:

I like to line up all of the names I associate with "sweet" or "innocent" ness on one side, words like Elizabeth, Mary, Clara.. And on the other side, names or words with more of a sexy bite to them, like Sharp, Frost, Hunt, Pierce... mix and match and play with them until something pops out at you. If you only want to write a book with a certain theme you can also incorporate words that are associated with that theme, like using "Sharp" as a last name if you want to write BDSM or "Heat" as a last name if you write primal, wild, shifter/jungle porn. "Twist" as a name if you wanna write gender-swapping... you get the idea.

## Backmatter

"Backmatter" is the collective term I use for the stuff that goes in your book after the story is over. It's generally composed of 3 parts: Excerpts, About the Author and Hyperlinks. The marketing purpose of all this backmatter is to create a regular reader or "fan," and to get him or her to keep buying more of your books, and also to establish your brand, as an author and finally, to make buying more of your stuff as easy as possible for readers.

### Excerpts

These should be short scenes (a few hundred words or so) that build up sexual tension and provide the reader a bit of background. You can cut and paste different parts together to create an intriguing excerpt, especially if between dialogue there's a paragraph of inner dialogue or backstory that makes more sense in the whole book. The point is to draw the reader in, and the work is yours, so you can manipulate the word order and context as much as you like.

Just don't... you know, lie about the content of the book. There is a good faith about this job. It should be "oh hey you liked this werewolf book? I have more, here's a little bit of what my other ones are like, go check them out!" and not, "OH HEY YOU LIKE THIS SO GO READ EVERYTHING PLZKBYE."

Another option for excerpts would be if you notice a book crawling up the charts and gaining a lot of popularity. High ranking leads to greater visibility, which leads to more sales.

But when you're starting out, it really is best to use the excerpts of any books you already have out. So say your only two books you have out are a naughty school girl x professor thing and a tentacle thing. Someone could be into both of those, so you could be losing out by not providing an excerpt.

As your catalogue grows, you can adjust your excerpt selections to be more appropriate in the last case.

I recommend (this is what I do) keeping a separate document titled "excerpts" and when you write a new book, pick an scene to use as an excerpt and then keep it on that document. This will keep your excerpts the same across all mediums and make it way easy to find books with similar themes/kinks instead of trying to recall your whole catalog. Just put the title and "(excerpt)" in underlined text above the scene so you know which book the scene belongs to.

### About the Author

This is where you get the opportunity to establish your "brand." What you're into, the types of books you want to write.

I have 3 pen names currently. My "main" is a college student who is one of those lady-in-the-streets, freak-in-the-sheets kinda girls, because that's general and when I started I wanted to write a variety of things to see what I liked and was best at. It may sound silly, but even just knowing that can be hot.

Your pen name is a character, and whether you want that character to be like the persona you may play here or not, that image a reader gets of you is part of the excitement of reading erotica.

Clara Hunt is the pen name I've associated with this reddit account, and all the books I write/will write are confessionals- sexscapades that are based on true stories. That'll be my "branding."

Of course, two authors can have the same branding approach. So if you also want to do confessionals, be my guest and I wish you luck and hit me up so we can do anthologies together.

AtA pages can be written by the author (in first person) or 3rd. I prefer 3rd because IMO it's easier to say "Clara Hunt is a ..." than "Hey I'm Clara Hunt and I do this." I also think it sounds more formal/professional. But, conversely, if you want to look more friendly, taking the first person approach could be better for your image.

### Hyperlinks

This is where you make doing everything VERY EASY for readers. They saw your excerpt, or liked your work in general and want more of it. Boom, link right there under the AtA ending. Hyperlinks are usually made by highlighting the text you want to make clickable, and then right click and there should be an "edit hyperlink" or "hyperlink" option. If you have trouble, google how to do it for your specific word-writing program. To make this easy to read I'll put the text that you'd put on the document, and then where the link should lead to next to it.

* _Read More_ link should go to your author page, or to the search results of your author name
* _Leave a Review!_ link should go to the book's individual page
* _Follow me on..._ twitter, face book, google+, whatever social networking you want to do or are doing. Be sure to list it, so the readers know.
* If you've purchased a cover, give the artist credit and link to their site or blog.

Another very important thing:

Most websites/retailers will lose their goddamn minds if you hyperlink to a competitive site. So you have to make several different version with their own hyperlinks, and upload them to the proper distributor. It's just as simple as copying and pasting new links, then "saving as" a new file name, so it's not difficult, it's just very tedious.

I save them all as different file names. For example...

* AbbreviatedBookTitle-AMZN.doc
* ABT-BN.doc

for Amazon hyperlinks, and Barnes and Noble hyperlinks respectively.

# IV. Pricing and DRM

In this chapter I will go over how to set up accounts, how to upload and how each distributor/retailer pays you and alllllllllllllllllllll that good stuff. But for now, I'm so sorry, I have to chuck more information at you. One of the key components to self employment is education, and that's why my guides are so detailed. You have to know what you're doing, or you might fuck up. And that could be no big deal, or it could be a very big deal.

## Pricing and Royalties

Royalties in the self publishing world aren't as cut and dry as they are in other places. This is largely because you're selling your stuff internationally, and currency conversion comes into play. Also, big companies want to capitalize on the whole "self publishing" thing without losing too much money, but still while agreeing to let authors have a fair royalty cut.

Basically:

* The standard price for 1 erotic short story is $2.99
* Anything $2.99-$9.99 earns you \~70% royalties.
* Anything greater than 9.99, or less than 2.99 earns you only \~35% royalties.

I will refer to these as **standard royalties**, as most retailers and distributors go with this split.

You might be thinking about making your books free or for .99 or 1.99. I don't advise this for starting out, because you have to sell 6 copies to make the same amount on 1 book sale if your book was priced at 2.99.

However, once you have a good, big catalog, pricing your books at those lower prices and taking the royalty hit will give you good visibility and up your ranks. It's a great marketing technique, but only when you have the content to back it up. Otherwise you're just selling yourself short.

Why do all of the prices end in .99? It's a mix of two things- first, that was the only way to get your work on Apple's iBookstore, but now it is just standard. You can still find erotica (and other books, I'm sure) that doesn't end with .99, but ultimately, it is standard now. Also, royalties, it's the lowest you can price while still getting 70%.

### Bundles

**Bundles** are discounted collections of books. So if you have a lot of books with a similar theme/kink/fetish, or a series, throw all of those babies in one .doc, make a new cover for it and throw that baby up.

Bundles are a GREAT marketing tool because you snag the bargain shoppers, you get more money for them, and visibility.

1 book priced at the standard 2.99 will earn you \~$2. That's great and fine and everything, but check out the standard prices and how much you'll make on bundles:

2 book bundles... $4.99 | \~ $3.50

3 book bundles... $6.99 | \~$4.90

4 book bundles... $8.99 | \~$6.30

5 book bundles... $9.99 | \~$7.00

Now, I realize that those books packaged individually at $2.99 each will make you more outright than the bundle will. It's all math:

5 * 2 = $10

10 > 7

It's a marketing move to bundle. It's cheaper for the customer, which theoretically makes it more appealing than a single short story, and increases your visibility, which will raise your sales. Also, it makes updating the documents so much easier and convenient, especially once you have a large catalog.

Bundle covers have taken the "boxed set" appearance, so it's very clear there are multiple books in it. [Here's an example](http://www.amazon.com/Boxed-Set-Rocked-Billionaire-Vol-ebook/dp/B00IA8SHRC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400593487&sr=8-1&keywords=boxed+set)

Also, you can still leave the individual books up as well to make money for you. Just be clear in the description of the bundle to list which books are included in it so customers don't buy the same one twice and then get angry at you over it.

Don't put the same book in two different bundles, even if you list in the description of both. It's considered bad practice and will reflect poorly on you to potential readers.

Some authors, especially friends or ones who write in similar themes will bundle together and arrange for a royalty split.

### About Payments

You get paid on a monthly basis. The site tracks how many sales you make, which you can follow through the dashboards, and on the 1st of each month, the sales sheet clears and your payment begins to process.

Some places require you to have a minimum profit before they send you money. It's usually a low number, like $10 for electronic deposits, and higher ($100) for physical cheques.

Processing your payments takes time, some take about a month, some take two and some take 45 days and some only pay you quarterly.

In short, any income you make on this will be monthly, and there might be a delay. For example, the deposit you get in April could be the money you made in January sales. This has both good and bad aspects.

Bad because "it's my money and I want it now!" and it can be hard to keep going without that money you made in your hands right now. Bad because living on a monthly income SUCKS.

Good because you know EXACTLY how much money you will get at the end of the month and can budget and plan accordingly, or even decide you need to make X amount of money during the month to cover your bills. Good because it will quickly teach you about budgeting.

## DRM

DRM stands for **digital rights management** and it's an encryption code that you may opt to have put in your ebook file that is supposed to prevent people from giving your ebook to other people or online for many people to access for free.

Unfortunately, DRM as it is currently is heavily flawed and tends to cause frustration for honest buyers, and can be striped from an ebook with certain software anyways. Once you decide to put it on your ebook you cannot change your mind.

I come from a family of readers and ebook readers, and in my opinion, sharing great books with other people is one of the fundamental joys of reading, even for erotica, and DRM makes that impossible (or not, if someone has the software to strip it from an ebook file). Retailers also use it to prevent people from reading ebooks purchased from them on competitive eReading devices, which is just plain dishonest and mean in my opinion. Because of all of this, I choose not to encrypt my books with DRM.

# V. Major Distributors & Retailers, Uploading, Account Set-Up...

First, the difference between a Retailer and a Distributor:

* A retailer is a website that sells your books on its own storefront. Most have their own uploading platform, but not all.
* A distributor is a place you upload your book to, and they distribute your books to other retailers.

Amazon, Barnes & Noble, AllRomanceEbooks and Kobo are examples of retailers.

Smashwords and Draft2Digital are examples of distributors.

Uploading directly to a retail site is almost always better than trusting a distributor to go through it. It's easier and faster and better for you to have direct control of how your books appear on each individual retail site because you have more control over your book, and the changes you implement go through faster.

Distributors are good for your visibility by getting you into smaller markets, stores, etc where the retailers don't have an uploading platform. Usually they do take a portion of your royalties, but the places they'll be sending your stuff to are either so small it doesn't matter, or too big that it doesn't matter. But don't let that discourage you, overall it's a fine arrangement.

And now some terms to know...

* "requires unique hyperlinks?" if yes, the links in your backmatter need to go directly to your pages that are hosted on the website in question.
* "exclusive publishing?" means that you can ONLY publish that specific book on that retailer/distributor. Uploading and selling your book to other places is a violation of their terms.
* "upload speed" means how long it takes after uploading for your book to become purchasable.

## AllRomanceEbooks

\[All Romance Ebooks\](allromanceebooks.com) is a **retailer** with its own uploading platform.

Before you can sell at ARe, you need to have a few books under your belt, because they are very strict about content and want to see what you write before they let you sell there. I believe you can upload there if you're not in the US, but your ebooks must be written in English.

**Basic Info**

* Royalties: 60%
* Payments: quarterly, approx 45 days after the close of the quarter.
* Allows book returns?: No.
* Upload Speed: Instant
* Content restrictions: EXTREMELY strict. NO "taboo" content, no dubcon/noncon/rape, no "barely legal" or "first time" or "young girl/older man* stuff, nothing illegal, cover images can't be too explicit.
* Requires unique hyperlinks? no.
* Exclusive publishing? no.

For more info, check out their [FAQ](http://www.allromanceebooks.com/faq-2.html)

To set up account [go here](https://www.allromanceebooks.com/publisherRegistration.html). If link is broken:

* Go to homepage
* Click the "Publisher/Author" link at the top. Second from right.
* "Click Here" to register as a publisher on ARe/Omnilit.

It should take you to a .html page that asks for your company/publisher info. I've filled one out and provided it [here](http://i.imgur.com/qH9eUGc.jpg) as a visual guide. The following two sections are pretty straightforward.

After you put in your application, you need to contact them and ask for an ISBN code to use.

**Uploading Your Ebook**

Access your publishing dashboard by the "Publisher/Author" link at the top. Log in with your info. Select "publisher" account.

First, go to "Author Maintenence" and be sure your pen name is listed as one of their approved authors. If it isn't, there's a link at the top to add an author that will bring up a window for you to fill out.

Go to "Book Maintenance" and click the "add a book" there at the top left. A window will pop up that asks for your title & ISBN.

This work has not been previously published. Select appropriate genre, most of us will be Fiction/Erotica.

Here, unlike with other places, you can only upload your book in the file formats that you sell. One way to do this is to put your .doc (or whatever) into 2epub.com and download the epub file. _protip: when you put in the author/title info, don't use spaces._

You can choose to upload just the .epub file. But you could also get some conversion software like [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) and convert into most of the formats ARe offers to sell in. I recommend .mobi, .epub, and .pdf- they sell the most and are the most versatile file types for eReaders.

Fill out book info. Most of it has explanations right there. For flame ratings, read their descriptions and use your best judgment.

**My Notes about ARE**

They're a privately run retailer with a huge audience, which is why they're so strict about content and they can be ban-happy and picky about who they let sell there. Most of their audience is romance readers however...

They have another population of people who love the shit out of shifter and monster erotica, so if you want to write some of that, I highly recommend taking the time to upload there.

If you have a lot of taboo and dub/non-con in your catalog, or other stuff they don't approve of, but still want to upload there, your chances aren't totally shot. Contact them directly and explain that you have absolutely no intentions of uploading content they disapprove of, be sincere (and HONEST) and your chances of getting approved will be higher. Worse case, by then, they'll tell you to write more content they approve of and apply again later.

## [Amazon](https://kdp.amazon.com/)

Amazon is a **retailer** with its own uploading platform.

**Basic Info**

* Royalties: standard
* Payments: monthly, with a 2 month delay. You get paid for January's sales in March.
* Allows book returns? yes.
* Upload speed: 12-24 hours.
* Content restrictions: NO Illegal content. Taboo okay. Amazon has an adult filter, that your books will go into if the reviewers deem too adult for their search engines. See my notes for more information. They care more about how your book looks than how it is on the inside.

Requires unique hyperlinks?: Yes.

Exclusive publishing?: Only if you enroll your book in KDP Select.

For more info check out their [Help Pages](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?ref_=kdp_REP_TN_help).

To make your account, sign up with the kdp link provided [here](https://kdp.amazon.com/). In Company/Publisher Name, put your REAL information, including your REAL name. No one will see it, the info is used for your tax documents, though, so it has to be your real name.

After you put in the rest of your tax information, **set all of those Amazon platforms- the .co.uk, .de, .fr... to deposit into your bank (EFT) into your currency.** I didn't do this and got some like 200 pounds in cheque form sitting in a filing cabinet that I had to pay taxes on, because the bank I use doesn't deal with foreign currency. Don't make my mistake.

**Uploading Your Ebook**

It's pretty straight forward, but [here's a visual guide](http://imgur.com/a/Yp4qd) if you need help. Go to kdp.amazon.com and sign in to start.

**My Notes about Amazon**

Most authors will tell you to try and avoid their adult filter. I think it's a waste of time, because their content guidelines are so damn broad anyways, and the people who want taboo content seem to know how to find it.

The adult filter basically hides your book from the search engine, which does suck for your visibility, but if you're going to write a lot of it, you're probably better off just calling it what it is. I wish I could give you guys a straight answer about what to do with your taboo content, but the truth is, Amazon is so fucking finicky about it that the best thing you can do is just whatever you want to do, and then see how Amazon responds to it, and then adjust accordingly.

If you want to avoid the Adult Filter, the following words cannot be in your title or description:

* Aunt/Uncle
* Babysitting/babysitter
* Banged
* Breeding/Bred
* Cheerleader
* Daddy/Mommy
* Forced
* In-law
* Incest
* Milked
* Schoolgirl
* Slave
* Son/Daughter
* Step-(whatever)
* Taken
* Used
* Virgin

That list isn't all-inclusive either, there's probably a bunch more. You can use them as keywords when uploading your book, though, so riddle me that. Taboo content, if it's been filtered, can only be seen if accessed through your author page. Or so they say, but I just searched my name and my PI title showed up just fine. Damn it, Amazon.

Anyways. If you want to play it safe, go with "Taboo" and use extended disclaimers on the inside. If you like to live dangerously, just upload it and see what Amazon does. I would say you should probably play it safe if you're new, but I have 2 incest/taboo titles under Clara Hunt and neither got filtered. So. Roll of the dice, it seems. If you're writing dub/noncon though, you should really probably play it safe.

Amazon will probably be your biggest source of income. It is for most authors, so it's highly recommended you upload there.

**About KDP Select** You get promotions and such to use if you enroll your book. I recommend, and am a huge proponent of trailblazing, once you get grounded in self publishing, try it on a book or two and see what it does for you. But proceed with caution. Amazon takes copyright claims VERY seriously, so be CERTAIN your book isn't available at any other retailer or online. Amazon has been known to completely shut down author accounts over this- costing erotica authors a lot of money and headaches.

## Apple

You can't upload directly here unless you have an Apple device. Which I don't, so I don't. I don't even know how to do it if you do, and I'm not inclined to bother looking it up because I hear it's an incredible pain in the ass. But that's a digression. You can still get their sweet, sweet smutbux, though.

Distributors that will put your book on Apple:

* AllRomanceEbooks
* Draft2Digital (recommended)
* Smashwords

Apple will tell the distributor if your book isn't accepted, and the distributor will then tell you, maybe, depending on who you're going through.

## [Barnes & Noble](https://www.nookpress.com/)

When B&N's publishing platform came out it was different than nookpress. I hope that link will have some kind of "sign up" option and you can go from there. I'm afraid to log out because I think I changed my password to something obscure and I'm afraid I won't be able to get back in. So if you have questions, ask and gimme some screenshots and I'll figure it out for you. I do remember, though, that when I signed up they asked for some kind of phone confirmation that I was a real person or something, so if that happens again, it's legit, don't worry.

**Basic Info**

* Royalties: standard; at 65%
* Payments: monthly, with a 2 month delay. You get paid for January's sales in March.
* Allows book returns? yes.
* Upload speed: 12-24 hours.
* Content restrictions: No illegal content. Taboo welcomed with opened arms, no filter.
* Requires unique hyperlinks?: Yes.
* Exclusive publishing?: No.

For more information, check out the "support" link at the top of your author/publisher dashboard.

**Uploading your Ebook**

In the "projects" tab select "create new book." Follow instructions.

After you select your cover, B&N requires the 1000x1500 size, be sure you hit "upload" and see your cover there before moving on.

Be weary! In the "Publisher/Author" tab, B&N has a nasty habit of putting your REAL NAME under "publisher" and "author." Just change them both to your pen name.

At the end of all the tabs, look for the green "Publish" button on the top right of the "Editorial review" screen. You don't need an ER to publish your book, if you don't have one, just leave that blank and publish.

**My Notes about B&N**

I love it. Easy to upload. I actually make more money there than I do on Amazon with my main pen name. Will probably be a big source of income for you, especially with the lack of content strictness.

The weirdest thing about Barnes and Noble is the people who leave reviews. We've seen some shit- people role playing and talking nonsense and shit to each other and using the reviews as a chat system. They've gotten better at responding to reports of those though so you can clean them up a bit.

## [Draft2Digital](https://www.draft2digital.com/login/)

Sign up there on the top right. D2D is a **distributor**, though there have been whispers about them opening their own storefront, which would be amazing because they are, by FAR, the best book distributor. When you sign up they have it right there displayed clearly where to put your real name and your pen name.

After you sign up, you're going to want to go into YOUR ACCOUNT and set up all the nitty-gritty stuff. I recommend ONLY putting your real name in your payment info pages, for everything else use your pen name.

**Basic Info**

* Royalties: They take 15% of net royalties. [Explained further](https://www.draft2digital.com/pricing/)
* Payments: Monthly, specific delays and such are dependent upon who you distribute to. Most are 2 months.

**Uploading**

For your files you upload to D2D I highly recommend stripping your book down to just the story. When you upload, you can opt to add in title, copyright pages, about the authors, excerpts and links to your other stuff and D2D really does a great job of making it look beautiful and professional.

"My Books" link at the top, big orange button to add new books. Follow instructions.

Don't overlook the "upload cover image" on the second page. Upload the full size image.

When selecting places to publish your book, **DO NOT** select places you're already publishing to. That will make your book show up twice on that retailer and it will reflect badly on you.

**My Notes about D2D**

Use it for distributing to Apple and Kobo, and Barnes and Noble if you aren't in the US and can't upload there directly. I love it, and I make an OK chunk of money from Apple every month. Definitely a necessity for non-US authors and publishers.

## Other Retailers & Distributors

* Excessica
* Excitica
* Google
* Kobo
* Smashwords
