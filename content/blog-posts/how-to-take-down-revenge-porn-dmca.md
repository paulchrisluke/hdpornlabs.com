# About DMCA

* The Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides protection from copyright infringement lawsuits for service providers. This protection manifests itself in immunity from being sued for infringement, but they must take reasonable and swift action to remedy an infringement once they are notified. Since they do not want to lose their immunity from copyright infringement, if you notify them of an ongoing infringement they will almost always order the website owner to take down the infringing material, or they will. [source](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2009/07/06/sample-dmca-take-down-letter/id=4501/)
* DMCA is US Law, and may not be honored by web servers that are housed internationally. However, most web servers are hosted in the US, which means most people can file a claim.
* hotlinking vs hosting:

**Hotlinking** is the use of a linked object, often an image, from one site by a web page belonging to a second site. If a website only hotlinks to your content, it means it does not have it stored in its database.

**Hosting** is the storing of information, pictures, videos and whathaveyou. If a website hosts your photos, it means it does have it stored in its database.

An example you may more easily understand is: Reddit often _hotlinks_ to images that are _hosted_ on imgur.com.

You may file a DMCA claim for both hosted and hotlinked content.

# Sending the DMCA Claim

You are allowed to have a representative send a DMCA takedown notice on your behalf (this is most common for big companies, but it can work on the individual level as well.) It is all in the way you phrase your letter in regards to whether the request is honored.

The sample letter has brackets for you to fill in what has been violated, and also brackets that include phrasing for if you chose to present yourself as an authorized representative.

## required items

Some sites may try to make this process more difficult than it needs to be, claiming you have to do extra things in order for them to honor your request. All you need to know is that your takedown notice needs to have the following information in it:

1. It must specify the content that you believe to be infringing upon your intellectual property rights.
2. You must state that your complaint is being made in “good faith”
3. You must also state, that “under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in the notification is accurate”*
4. You must state that you have legal right to take such, and further, action as the copyright owner or agent of the same.
5. It must include accurate contact information.*
6. It must be signed(electronic signature is fine)

\*please see "providing fake vs. real information

## sample letter

I am \[the exclusive rights holder / the duly authorized representative of the exclusive rights holder\] for \[type of media being violated; photos, videos, etc.\];

1. These exclusive rights are being violated by material available upon your site at the following URL(s): \[URLs of infringing material\];
2. I have a good faith belief that the use of this material in such a fashion is not authorized by the copyright holder, the copyright holder's agent, or applicable law;
3. Under penalty of perjury in a United States court of law, I certify that the information contained in this notification is accurate, and that I am authorized to act \[on behalf of the holder of the exclusive rights\] to the material in question;
4. I may be contacted by the following method: \[email/phone/etc. Only use what you use for work, such as an email address. Most places will notify you here that they've honored your request.\];

I hereby request that you remove or disable access to this material as it appears on your service in as expedient a fashion as possible. Thank you.

Regards,

\[Name\]

## Fake vs. Real Information

When filing a DMCA claim, it is recommended you use fake information if you wish to remain anonymous about your sex work. There is no way for them to know your information is real to begin with, and just by sending the DCMA you're confirming you have the right to make the claim. Whatever information you provide in the DMCA claim gets sent to the infringer. And while they are legally required to remove your content, information is power and they could distribute that information as a means of "getting back" at you.

[/u/legendarylootz](https://old.reddit.com/u/legendarylootz)[ ](javascript:void 0 "set a tag")once sent a DMCA claim with fake information about a video, and the video was rehosted with the information (her "name") in the title.

Another tactic you use use is attach a fake real-sounding name to your adult content usernames and aliases. This way, should your content be rehosted, it could be used to build a following and benefit you.
