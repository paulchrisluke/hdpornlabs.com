Do you feel limited with your payment options, compared to what our American friends are able to offer and accept? Are you sick of receiving snail mail checks from camsites and clipsites who don't offer better international payout methods?

Fret no more! A solution is here.

Select Canadian banks offer Canadians the opportunity to open American bank accounts, without crossing the border! A quick Google search shows that this option is available through both TD Canada Trust, and RBC. It is not currently available through CIBC, Scotia Bank, or BMO. RBC has better monthly rates, but if you're already with TD, it may be worth sticking with them simply for the sake of ease.

# How It Works

It's quite simple.

* If you're already with one of the banks that offers this service, you only need to apply for an American account.
* If you're not with one of the banks that offers this service, you will need to apply for an American _and_ a Canadian account. This way you can transfer your funds from one to the other without transaction fees. If you transfer funds from, for example, an RBC US account to a CAD CIBC account, it will not be free.
* Make sure you are clear that you want to open a bank account _in the States_, not just that you want one in American currency. That's another type of account altogether.

Because you're opening an American account at a Canadian branch, your application will take a few days to go through, as the documents need to be sent to the American branch for approval. Once you're done, you can start accepting direct payment methods that would typically require a US bank account, as well as switch from snail mail checks to direct deposit/ACH wire transfers with most cam/clip sites.
