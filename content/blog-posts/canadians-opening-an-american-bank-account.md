# \[cam\] - Skype and similar cam shows

Cam prices are generally determined based on the content of the show and length. Most sellers price per minute and have a minimum length (often ten minutes). Some sellers utilize block pricing.

The average cost per minute for a solo cam show is $3-5.

Block pricing tends to average around $60 for 15 minutes, or $100 for 30 minutes.

It is very common to see higher prices for fetish shows, those requiring preparation, or clean up.

Cam prices also may vary based on equipment. Some sellers use a built-in laptop webcam, while others have a dedicated (and more expensive) webcam and sometimes microphone purchased for camming.

# \[dom\] - Service where seller is dominant

Domination Kik sessions tend to be priced a bit higher than usual Kik costs; the same goes for cam and GFE.

Domination tasks are usually a single task, sometimes given with photos/video instructions. They typically average $20 per task. Some sellers offer blocks of tasks for a discounted price (e.g. 5 tasks for $80).

# \[gfe\] - Girlfriend experience

Every seller handles GFE differently, and therefore prices vary widely. Some offer more interaction during the day than others. Many offer multiple packages based on the amount of interaction, frequency of chatting, or availability/length of included sexting sessions. Some sellers also require a several day trial before a longer length of time can be purchased.

A one day GFE averages $50-$75.

One week is one of the most common offerings, at $100-$250.

Some sellers advertise month-long GFEs, averaging $500-$750.

# \[kik\] - Sexting and other Kik services

Similar to cam, Kik is typically sold per minute or in block prices. Many sellers have different prices for text only sessions, video heavy sessions, showing face, or using props/toys. An additional fee for outfit requests or clean up is also common. Most sellers have a 10-15 minute minimum. The following averages reflect sessions prices that are specified with pictures and videos:

* $2/minute
* 15 minutes: $30
* 30 minutes: $55
* 45 minutes:$75
* 60 minutes: $100

# \[pic\] - Pictures for sale

Photo sets generally run $1-$3 per photos. A minimum order number is very common, with 10 photos being the norm. Some sellers offer a discount for large photosets, such as 20+ photos.

# \[pty\] - Panties

Panty prices are affected by variables such as the cost of the panty, wear time, fetishes (such as pee/scat), and other add ons. One day wear averages $35. Two day wears average $45.

Extra days of wear average $10. Many sellers have a limit on how many days they will wear a pair of panties.

Extra photos, usually while wearing the panties, average $2 per photo.

Some sellers include shipping in the price, but not all. Many will offer expedited shipping (such as overnight) if the buyer wants to pay the difference.

# \[rate\] - Cock/body rates

Cock rates are frequently offered as text only or video. Videos can be clothed, nude, and offered as short Kik videos or a more expensive, downloadable video.

The average price for a text only rate is $10.

The average price for video rates ranges from $20-$60, depending on length and the quality of video. Some sellers have much shorter videos than others, and some use professional filming equipment for cock rates.

# \[snp\] - Snapchat subscriptions

Many sellers will run their Premium Snapchat in different ways. Some offer daily photos, some offer a show a few times a week, and anything in between. Some sellers send photos directly and some just post to a story. Additionally, some sellers include chatting and allow screenshots while others do not.

Monthly subscriptions average $15-$20. Six months averages $50-$70. A year long subscription averages $100.

# \[vid\] - Custom and premade videos

Custom videos are generally priced based on content and length. Many sellers price by minute, usually ranging from $4-$10 per minute, which the average at $6 per minute. Factors such as camera contribute to the wide range of prices.

Some sellers use block pricing, averaging about $50 for approximately five minutes, or $90 for a ten minute video.

Custom video pricing usually assumes that the video can be resold unless specified otherwise. Many will charge an exclusive fee if they cannot resell the video, due to buyer request or the content on the video. Name use can also require a video to be exclusive, or have a higher fee. Exclusive fees can be a flat fee anywhere from $25-$200, or can be an increased per minute price.

Premade videos are generally priced near $1 per minute.
