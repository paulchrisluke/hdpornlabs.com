## Bitcoin / Ethereum / Litecoin (aka "crypto")

One of the best options, being that they are **anonymous**, and do not shut down adult transactions. Bitcoin sometimes takes 30 minutes - 1 hour to be processed, but usually no longer than that. Ethereum and Litecoin tend to be much faster, and are great options as (nearly) **instant** processors. They also work well as **international** payment options!

Be sure to copy and paste the wallet address the seller provides you! If you send it elsewhere, the money is gone completely and cannot be retrieved.

Information on [**getting started**](https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started) with Bitcoin!

Although Coinbase is a popular option, they are not usually recommended-- they are not adult friendly.

[**More information**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellerCircleStage/wiki/bitcoin) on the benefits of Bitcoin, and how to use it both as a buyer and seller! Most of the information on Bitcoin is similar to Ethereum and Litecoin - they're all major cryptocurrencies.

## IndieBill

A fantastic payment method **specifically for adult transactions!!**. Age verification is required for sellers. Payouts are usually deposited to bank accounts twice per month, unless you use Boleyn Models. **IndieBill takes 15%** of each transaction. To make up for this, some sellers charge an additional fee, while others are happy to eat the cut for the protection they provide! Since IndieBill is based overseas, they do not issue 1099s.

To use IndieBill as a buyer, all you need to do is input a credit or debit card-- **it doesn't get any easier!** IndieBill is very anonymous; the only thing the seller will see is the **email address** you use. I also appears discreetly on your bank/credit card statement.

## CamModelDirectory and SkyPrivate

> CamModelDirectory.com is technically an advertising/networking site for camgirls, but can also be used to sell videos, mailable goods and other services. They do take a 25% fee, but if you take advantage of the self-advertising opportunities on the site, the extra business you gain through them can more than make up for what you lose when using it as a payment method with Redditors. Payment is instant and some sellers charge a slightly higher rate for buyers who use this method to compensate for the fee and convenience. Most buyers don't mind, as it means they can receive what they ordered immediately, in comparison to other payment options that take time to process.
>
> This is similar to CamModelDirectory, in that it is a payment platform as well as a means of self-advertisement. It's great for camshows, as it includes a Skype plug-in that tracks the duration of shows, and bills the viewer accordingly. This site also takes a 25% cut, but you can drop it to 20% if you refer enough people (buyers or sellers) to the site. SkyPrivate also allows direct payments (rather than by-the-minute charges for shows), which buyers can send in return for other goods and services outside of camshows. If you choose to try SkyPrivate, we highly recommend looking into how it works, as there is a lot to it at first. Once you get familiar with it, it's easy to use.

It is worth noting that CMD and SkyPrivate issue 1099s to sellers. 1099s are usually not an issue, but worth considering if you have future career plans that would be impacted by selling. Some fields such as education or government work can access tax records and see your 1099s.

## LiveCamModelShows

_Section credits go to_ [_/u/ClaraCrisp _](https://old.reddit.com/u/ClaraCrisp)_!_

**85/15% split** in your favor, payments weekly or monthly. Payment processor with categories for cam shows, texting services, custom clips and phone sex. Run by a cam girl (Jesse) and her husband, and support has always been very responsive. Getting featured on the front page is free and based upon your support of the site (updating your availability status and responding to community requests). Has a reasonable amount of organic traffic- less than CMD, more than Skyprivate. Interface is limited and profile updates are made via request form to the owners, but they follow through quickly.

### GirlsPrivateCam

Formerly just a listing site. Recently partnered with LCMS for their payment processing (85% split). I do not have much information on them, but my understanding is that they have quite a bit of traffic.

## AmateurPorn

_Section credits go to_ [_/u/ClaraCrisp _](https://old.reddit.com/u/ClaraCrisp)_!_

Clip site and payment processor showing a lot of potential. **80/20 split.** Video uploads have limited options at this time, but I have heard they are responsive to feedback. Video sales so far have been good and indicate they have traffic comparable to Clips4Sale and ManyVids.

## Clip Sites

_Section credits go to_ [_/u/clarabelle_says _](https://old.reddit.com/u/clarabelle_says)_!_

Clips4Sale, IWantClips and ManyVids are three of the largest clip sites and can be used for selling premade content, custom videos and **accepting tips/tributes from your fans**. All three of these sites offer the potential for significant income generated by clip sales, but focusing on clip sites can be a full time job in and of itself. Consistency is key in succeeding on clipsites, as is having a fanbase who is excited to purchase your content.

### Clips4Sale

Despite the outdated look and feel of the interface, C4S is a great marketplace for fetish content and has a 60% payout for premade sales and a **75% payout for tips** (which can be used to process payments for custom videos, though C4S does not endorse that practice). C4S also has the option to set up a membership site, a site that sells physical DVDs of your clips or an image site for photosets, though these options are less popular. There is a huge variety of content on C4S, in terms of fetishes, production value and price. Because of this, models who don’t show their face or who have a very amateur brand may do better on C4S than on other platforms.

### iWantClips

IWantClips is a rapidly expanding clipsite that also offers phone sex, sexting, custom video orders and a membership site as well. It pays out at **60% for clip sales and 100% for custom video orders** (although they tack on an additional fee for buyers on top of your price, so you will need to lower your price if you like to keep your prices the same across all platforms). IWC offers a lot of Domme content, but the higher payout and ease of placing custom videos orders make it popular among many different types of models.

### ManyVids

ManyVids recently celebrated becoming the biggest clipsite in the world. **Their payout is 60%** across all categories and they have many options for ways your fanbase can support you, including custom videos, a store section where you can sell panties and photosets, a tip/tribute function and many contests where you can offer special perks to your fans in return for their donations. ManyVids can be a difficult scene to break into because how gameified their ranking system is – a higher score (earned through sales, uploads and activity on the site) gets you more traffic and thus more sales. They have a very specific brand image and are quite choosey with the kind of content and models that they promote, but the interface of the site is clean and easy to use, making it very popular with buyers.

## Interac E-Transfer

_Section credits go to_ [_/u/HoneySavage _](https://old.reddit.com/u/HoneySavage)_!_

Described [here](http://interac.ca/en/interac-e-transfer-consumer.html?gclid=CKThu6b_ob0CFUVgMgod_BEAGw), this option is accessible through your online banking account and is available only if both the buyer and seller have **Canadian bank accounts**. On the receiving end, the process is extremely simple: the sender only needs to know your e-mail address, and may also be asked to set a password--it's ideal to **tell the sender a password** you'd like to use in advance to save yourself any guessing games. The sender will have to set you up as a recipient, and shortly after they send the e-transfer, you will receive an email addressed to the name they used. It does not have to match the name on the account the money will be deposited into, and upon successful deposit the sender receives an email saying that \[nickname\] has accepted their money transfer. They are not provided with any of your banking information.

As a recipient, you will receive this notification email saying that the sender has sent you a transfer within minutes (rarely, sometimes up to 20 minutes). From there, you can click on the link to deposit it at the bank of your choice. Unlike a recipient nickname, the name of the sender is by default the legal name attached to their bank account. If this poses a privacy concern, the sender can change their e-transfer settings from their online banking and choose initials or a different name to appear. This will apply to all e-transfers they send, so if the sender doesn't want to use this nickname for e-transfers to everyone, they'll need to change it back afterwards. The sender will also pay a $4 CAD administrative fee to the company that runs e-transfers.

This payment method is ideal for transactions between Canadians as it's quick and secure; there is no percentage cut taken by the processor; it requires no registration or set-up beyond having an existing bank account; and it is anonymous by default for the recipient, and can also be made anonymous for the sender. Furthermore, while the [Terms of Use](https://www.interac.ca/en/interac-e-transfer-terms-of-use.html) do prohibit illegal activity, they are unlike most mainstream payment methods in that they do not explicitly disallow transactions for adult services, which are legal to sell within Canada.

# Methods With Some Risks

## Amazon GC

Amazon gift cards are a very common option, since many buyers already have their credit/debit card information saved on Amazon, and many sellers already have Amazon accounts. Amazon giftcards are almost always instant.

Buyers, be sure to **send your seller a giftcard directly** through Amazon's website. Check with the seller if you should be sending from the **.com site** or another, based on the needed currency. Sellers, do not accept gift card codes; only use the code from the Amazon email. A common scam involves a screenshot with a code on that, but the only proof of payment is the email directly from Amazon, and redeeming the giftcard into your account.

Buyers must also be careful to not leave explicit messages in the notes, since Amazon is **not adult friendly**. Many sellers will have their own requirement for leaving a message, or the absence of. Additionally, if you are using your primary, personal Amazon account for buying these giftcards, you may want to change the name associated with the account. This is easily done through the Login & Security Settings, and is highly recommended for your own privacy.

Many sellers do charge a **small fee** for Amazon giftcards, since it cannot be used to cover shipping costs, nor is it deposited to a bank account as cash.

Additionally, sellers should be aware that they can provide a work email for receiving Amazon Giftcards, but can redeem to any account.

## Circle Pay

Previously used as Bitcoin, Circle is now only an option for sending USD. It's still instant and generally safe. However, Circle is **not adult friendly** and therefore there is still a risk of being shut down. Both buyers and sellers must have an account for Circle.

Never have buyers leave a note as they are not adult friendly and will shut down your account for breaching their TOS. Circle can be used in the US and many European countries.

## GiftRocket

Giftrocket takes 2-6 days to clear. Sellers are strongly recommended to not begin/deliver **any service** until Giftrocket money is in their account. Although Giftrocket is described as a gift card, it deposits into a bank account.

## Gyft

Gyft is the **only recommended method of accepting PayPal**. Similar to Amazon, Gyft is usually instant, and frequently comes with a small giftcard fee. Messages also must not be explicit, since Gyft isn't adult friendly.

Some sellers will request a general "Gyft" card, while others will specify a specific retailer such as Amazon. Sellers are encourage to spend the money quickly or use their Gyft balance to buy another card.

# Very Risky Methods

These methods are listed here because they are not adult friendly, and there is a **high potential for accounts being shut down.** Also note that we **will not** be able to assist with refunds with these payment methods.

## PayPal

PayPal is **not adult friendly and is never recommended.** We cannot recommend any more strongly **against using it.** Paypal is known to be ruthless in their shutting down of accounts used for adult purchases. PayPal also has it written in that if you go against their "Acceptable Use Policy" they have the right to fine you large sums of money ($2,500). You agree to this policy by agreeing to their Terms of Service.

More info: [https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#restricted-activities](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#restricted-activities "https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#restricted-activities")

**WARNING:** We **WILL NOT** support refunds if you purchase a service using PayPal, even if the seller does not deliver. We cannot recommend any stronger using a different payment method.

## Google Wallet

Google Wallet was once relatively safe, but now shuts down accounts frequently and is extremely risky to use. **Google Wallet is just as dangerous as Paypal.**

**WARNING:** We **WILL NOT** support refunds if you purchase a service using Google Wallet, even if the seller does not deliver. We cannot recommend any stronger using a different payment method.

## Venmo

Venmo is **owned by PayPal and has the same risks**. Since a note is required, buyers must be extremely cautious to leave a SFW note that does not bring about suspicion. Sellers are recommended to tell buyers what note to leave. Venmo is often one of the fastest to shut down a sellers account.

## Squarecash

It is strongly suggested that you do your own research on Squarecash; some sellers have had great experiences with it, others have not. Squarecash does have an instant deposit payment method (with a 1% fee on the sellers end) but it is uncertain how safe this is. Using SquareCash for **adult services is against their TOS**, use this payment method discreetly or strictly with buyers you trust.

Never leave an explicit note in the messages for Squarecash, they are known for **investigating these and shutting down both buyer and seller accounts**. You will often not be able to successfully make a new account with them after this happens.

## Cash/Mailed Payments

As a seller, you should never disclose your home address for obvious privacy reasons. Additionally, if cash/a check gets lost in the mail, this can make for a very tricky situation. For this and many other reasons, we cannot recommend any mailed payments.
