Many of our sellers have learned from experience which policies are essential to their business. The following are commonly held by most sellers. More important than using all of these is to decide what your policies are and stand by them.

## Receiving Payment

* **Most sellers refuse to use Paypal as a payment method.** Paypal shares your personal information including full name with buyers and freezes accounts if they are found to be using their service for adult work. If you need to use Paypal, accept Giftrocket cards and redeem them to your Paypal account. If the buyer needs to pay with Paypal, they can purchase cards for you from Gyft.com for a number of websites and stores using their Paypal account.
* **Wear of physical items and work on digital items does not begin until payment is received in full AND cleared into your accounts**. Many buyers disappear after making their requests. If you know you don't mind and can resell the materials, you can offer partial payment or payment upon delivery. Otherwise, receive payment first. For information on payment methods and the different amounts of time they take to clear, visit our [payment methods wiki page](https://old.reddit.com/r/sellercirclestage/w/paymentmethods).
* **Messages and names attached to payment must be discreet.** Most of our payment methods are not cleared for use with adult work and it's best not to raise red flags. Most sellers require buyers send discreet messages like "Congratulations!" or "Good luck!" rather than "For the JOI video and 8 pairs of dirty panties" when sending gift cards. If your username would raise red flags, be sure buyers are putting in a name or initials that you prefer when sending their payment.

## Refunds

* **No refunds for buyers who disrespect or harass you or become otherwise abusive.** Be clear when a buyer is making you uncomfortable or crossing a line. If they persist, contact moderators of the selling subreddits as soon as possible so they can support you and provide mediation.
* **Refunds must be issued with the same payment method they were sent in.** If a buyer sent an Amazon.com gift card, they can't request a Bitcoin refund and so on.
* Refund policies for buyers who are sincerely unhappy with the products they received differ from seller to seller. If you are unable or uncomfortable with providing a refund in these cases, make that clear to the buyer and offer them a discount on a future order, premade content, or some photos to improve their experience.

## Lost Packages

* **You can not be held responsible for lost packages.** To avoid a 'he said, she said' scenario, take note of the tracking on every package sent. You can either pay for it or use the PID# found on the receipt for every package sent with USPS. Good business sense is still encouraged if something goes amiss and many sellers will recommend offering a discount on a future order, a premade video, or similar offers. Redoing the order free of charge is rarely, if ever, encouraged.

## Private Custom Videos

* **Most sellers require the buyer pay a small to hefty fee to create private content** that you won't be allowed to resell. Otherwise, you own the copyright to your work and are free add the media to your catalog to resell if you please.
