## What is Bitcoin

[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) is a decentralized digital currency, which allows for instantaneous, peer-to-peer transactions. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2en3nHxA4) for a short explanation of what Bitcoin is.

**The goal of this guide**

This guide will not focus on the technical details of how Bitcoin works, but on why it is the best payment method for adult services, and how to get started with it. We will _not_ discuss Bitcoin trading/investing, only how to use it as a payment method.

If you would like to learn more about Bitcoin, [/r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) has a lot of resources for newcomers.

## Why should I use Bitcoin?

**1. It’s easy**

Although it may seem daunting to get started with Bitcoin, it is actually very easy. Setting up a Bitcoin wallet to receive Bitcoin payments only takes a couple of minutes! Registering with an exchange to buy Bitcoin in order to send payments can take slightly longer, but once you are registered, future Bitcoin purchases and payments are a piece of cake.

**2. It’s (practically) instant**

Bitcoin transactions show up within a few seconds to a few minutes, although confirmations from the network may take slightly longer.

**3. It’s cheap**

Transaction fees to send Bitcoin are very, very low. Compared to most conventional payment methods, especially international transactions, they are practically non-existent.

**4. It’s anonymous**

Your Bitcoin address is not linked to your name, your address, or any other personal details. However, note that you should still be careful with your personal information. Details of all Bitcoin transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. If someone has a Bitcoin address, they can see every transaction that has been made to that address, as well as the balance. However, they will not know who the address belongs to. Therefore, as long as you do not publicly associate your name or personal details with one of your Bitcoin addresses, you’re all good. Make sure to generate a new Bitcoin address for every payment for additional privacy.

**5. It's decentralized**

Bitcoin is not controlled by one person or central authority. Bitcoin is controlled by the Bitcoin network, which is the collection of machines that work together to mine Bitcoin and process Bitcoin transactions. That means that there is no bank or government that can decide what to do with Bitcoin, or take your Bitcoin away from you. Users control their own money, and can send each other Bitcoin without the use of a bank or other financial institution.

**6. It’s legitimate and safe for Adult services**

As there is no central authority that creates rules for Bitcoin, there are no terms of service that say Bitcoin cannot be used for Adult services. It is a legitimate and arguably the safest option for people in the Adult industry. However, please note that certain companies, like Coinbase, _do_ prohibit the use of their services for adult-related businesses – more on that later.

**7. There are no chargebacks or fake payments**

Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed. That means that once a buyer has sent you a payment, the only person who can remove them from your wallet is you. Payments cannot be cancelled and there are no chargebacks.

The fact that there is a public record of every Bitcoin transaction (see point 4 above) also means that both the sender and recipient of the Bitcoin can check the transaction, and there is no way for anyone to fake a payment or claim they did not receive the Bitcoin.

_Buyers are recommended to work with verified sellers only. Always discuss details of a service before sending money and check a seller’s terms regarding refunds._

## Buyers: How to pay in Bitcoin

**Step 1. Create an account on an exchange**

Although you can buy Bitcoin on any exchange (see below for recommendations), we will be using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) for demonstration purposes, as the interface and verification process are pretty straightforward, and it is available in most countries. Other exchanges have similar processes, but might sometimes be more difficult to navigate for beginners.

Bitcoin exchanges have to comply with laws and regulations for financial institutions, which is why most of them require verification. It is therefore important that you use your real information (name etc.) to create a Coinbase account, as this is used for verification.

Coinbase allows you to pick a “Nickname” in your account settings. This Nickname can be anything, and this (together with the Bitcoin address you send money from) is the only thing that ever will be shown to anybody you exchange Bitcoin with. Pick something that cannot be related to you (e.g. “John Doe”).

Once you’ve [created an account](https://i.imgur.com/Hr8LLUg.png), you will be guided through the process of [verifying your identity](https://i.imgur.com/H2h6XTd.png) and linking a payment method (such as a credit card or bank account). It is very easy to verify your ID: simply take a picture of your ID with your webcam or mobile phone.

This verification process is usually very quick, but can occasionally take a little longer. The steps are easy to follow and it is a one-time process: once your account is set up, you will be able to instantly buy, sell and transfer Bitcoin in the future.

**Step 2. Buy Bitcoin**

When your account is verified, you arrive on your [Coinbase dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/kyRgg0n.png). You can now buy Bitcoin! Go to the [“Buy/Sell” tab](https://i.imgur.com/Qx6L79g.png), choose a payment method and an amount. You can enter the amount in currency or in Bitcoin. Hit buy, [confirm the transaction](https://i.imgur.com/Yb2C7Om.png), and you’ve bought your first Bitcoin!

Please note that both buying and sending Bitcoin will incur a small fee, so buy slightly more than the cost of the service you are planning to purchase. Buying Bitcoin using a credit/debit card is practically instant.

**Step 3. Pay someone with Bitcoin**

With your newly acquired Bitcoin, you can pay for goods and services! To do so, go to [“Accounts”->”BTC wallet”->”send”](https://i.imgur.com/ZoiDkB2.png).

This is where you can send your Bitcoin from. Carefully copy the address you have been given by the person you want to send Bitcoin to, enter the amount, and hit send. As Coinbase does not condone the use of its wallet to pay for adult services, do _not_ add a message to your transaction unless requested to do so by the seller.

Make sure to copy the exact address and double check it! If you make even a small mistake, your Bitcoin will not arrive. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Because there is no central authority that controls Bitcoin and there is no way of knowing who owns an address, you will not be able to get your Bitcoin back if you accidentally send it to the wrong address.

After you send your Bitcoin, it might take a little while for the network to confirm the transaction. You can see the status of your transaction under “Accounts”.

## Sellers: How to get paid in Bitcoin

**Step 1. Create a wallet**

To start accepting payments in Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet. This is where you receive and store your Bitcoin. There are different types of wallets: paper, desktop, mobile, web, or hardware. Which type of wallet you use is entirely up to your preferences, but generally speaking, mobile wallets are a great solution for lots of small transactions as they are easily accessible, and most have 2-factor authentication for security.

If you plan on making large transactions and/or storing Bitcoin for an extended period of time, you might want to consider investing in a hardware wallet, which provides an additional layer of security. Further down on this page is a list of recommended wallets.

**Step 2. Generate an address**

While the exact procedure for this depends on the wallet you’re using, there will be a “receive” or “generate address” option in your wallet. Here you can generate an address at which you can receive Bitcoin. An address is a string of letters and numbers. Give this address to the person paying you. This is where they will be sending their Bitcoin.

Make sure to copy the exact address! If you make even a small mistake, you will not receive your Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Because there is no central authority that controls Bitcoin and there is no way of knowing who owns an address, you will not be able to get your Bitcoin if you accidentally give someone the wrong address.

**Step 3. Get paid!**

When your buyers sends Bitcoin to the address you generated, it will show up in your wallet. This is generally within a couple of minutes. Once it has been sent, it may take a little while to be confirmed by the network, so you might not be able to spend your Bitcoin immediately. To be totally safe, it is best to wait until the transaction is confirmed before delivering any services.

**Step 4. “Withdrawing” your Bitcoin (i.e. exchanging Bitcoin for another currency)**

**4A.** _Create exchange account_

To “withdraw” Bitcoin to your bank account, you first need to sell it in exchange for another currency (e.g. US dollars). This is done on an exchange. One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges is [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), which is available in most countries. To create an account, follow Step 1 of “How to pay in Bitcoin” above.

**4B.** _Transfer Bitcoin to exchange_

Once you have created an account and verified it, you can transfer your Bitcoin to your Coinbase wallet to sell it.

_Please note that we recommend you only use your Coinbase account to cash out your Bitcoin. We do not recommend using Coinbase as a wallet to receive Bitcoin from buyers, as they prohibit the use of their platform for adult services in their TOS. The best procedure is to receive your Bitcoin into a separate wallet (see below for recommendations), and then transfer it to Coinbase (or another exchange) to sell. If you decide to disregard this and use Coinbase as your primary wallet anyway, you can skip this part and move on to C._

To transfer your Bitcoin to your Coinbase wallet, generate an address for your Coinbase wallet like in Step 2 [(“Accounts”->”BTC wallet”->”Receive”)](https://i.imgur.com/HuqnsVR.png). Then, using the wallet where your money is kept, follow Step 3 of “How to pay in Bitcoin” to send your Bitcoin to the Coinbase address.

**4C.** _Sell Bitcoin and withdraw_

Once your Bitcoin is in your Coinbase Bitcoin wallet, you can trade your Bitcoin for another currency by going to [“Buy/Sell”-> “Sell”](https://i.imgur.com/W7e9dCd.png), and choosing the amount you wish to trade. Your currency will be deposited to your account in the currency you chose. To withdraw, go to “Accounts”, select your currency wallet, and withdraw to your linked payment method.

## Things to keep in mind

**Bitcoin is volatile**

The price of Bitcoin fluctuates a lot, which is important to keep in mind if you are dependent on the money you make in Bitcoin. Unless you immediately sell your Bitcoin upon receipt, you may lose/gain money. A lot of people believe that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise, but this is not guaranteed, and there are ups and downs. Consider whether this is a risk you are willing to take if you do not cash out.

**Earnings in Bitcoin are taxable**

Laws surrounding Bitcoin will continue to change as governments decide how to approach cryptocurrencies. The fact that Bitcoin is anonymous does not mean that it is not taxable. Depending on where you live, Bitcoin may be treated as either a currency or an asset, and you will need to pay the appropriate taxes over your Bitcoin earnings (generally income tax or capital gains tax). You are responsible for filing your own taxes. Consult a local accountant for tax advice.
