This is a list of every method available for creating decent to high quality GIFs. If you have a suggestion for another method, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSellerCircleStage) and let us know!

**Basics and Terms**

When creating GIFs, you want to create the smallest file size while keeping the quality intact. These are some of the terms you need to know.

* **Frames** - A GIF is made of a series of images and a frame is one still image. You'll see settings for frames per second, frame count (total frames from GIF start to finish), and frame delay (amount of time spent on a frame).
* **Playspeed** - The speed the GIF will play at, you will most often want to match it to your source video but can make a GIF go slow motion or slightly sped up by changing the playspeed.
* **Pixels** - A measurement you'll use to set the width and height of your GIF. If your video's width is 720p (pixels) or 1080p, you may want to scale down to about 500 pixels or less across.
* **Pallette and Colors** - Many programs will offer options to convert or simplify the color pallette. You may need to test your GIFs with different color settings to find what works best for you.
* **HTML5** - The future of GIFs, also known as .gfy or .gifv. When sharing very large GIFs, you'll want to make sure you're using the better version of your GIFs. Both hosting websites recommended below will convert your GIF and give you HTML5 links as well as .gif links.

## GifCam (Windows)

| Cost | Quality | Link | Tutorials |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Medium | http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/ | \[1\] |

This program requires no installation. It works by filming your screen while it plays a video and arranges a GIF based on that recording.

## FreeVideotoGifConverter (Windows)

| Cost | Quality | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Medium/High | http://www.video-gif-converter.com/ |

Very lightweight program that creates great quality GIFs and lets you delete frames easily. Some recommended settings are scaling down to about 500 px wide, 15 to 20 frames per second, and using 6 to 12 second clips.

## GifBrewery (Mac)

| Cost | Quality | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $4.99 | Medium/High | http://appstore.com/mac/gifbrewery/ |

This program is finicky but it's one of few available and it creates a good quality gif. Set to "automatically calculate count & delay" and choose a frame count between 10 and 20.
