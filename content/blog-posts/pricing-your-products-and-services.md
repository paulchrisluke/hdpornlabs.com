Please keep in mind that every seller is different and appeals to different markets. Some sellers will be able to charge twice as much and others sellers will be a few dollars short. This guide is just meant to give a normal price range. The golden rule in ANY form of sales is to start high and to negotiate down. You'd be surprised at how many people will be happy to pay the higher price!

## Don't Undervalue Yourself

Many studies have shown that people associate low prices with inferior quality and will almost always purchase a higher priced item because it gives them a sense of pride that they bought the more expensive item....even if the items are exactly the same. It's simple human psychology! We are programed to want the better thing unless we think that we are the only one who got a better deal!

You'll be tempted to make sales by marking down your prices. Please understand how this affects the community over time. Under pricing has become a big issue lately and unfortunately it causes the selling community as a whole to degrade. Buyers will come to expect more for less. There are many selling communities out there where this has become such an issue that there are sellers literally working for pennies. We do not want Reddit to follow suit.

## Physical Items

### Panties

There are a lot of variables in panty selling such as type of panty, wear time, specialty wear, and add ons. On average 2 days of wear seems the most popular at $35-$45. One day wear averages $25-$35.

As far as extra wear and add ons go the following is a table of average price:

* Extra days of wear - $10
* Specialty/Fetish wear - $10-$20 over base price
* Extra photos - $2 per photo

Most sellers include shipping and vacuum sealing (if you have it) with the price. Most sellers offer expedited shipping to buyers if the buyer wants to pay the difference.

### Pussy Pops

Prices range from $6 to $15 per pussy pop. Many sellers offer discounts for extra pops and offer different pricing for sucked pops, pussy pops, and anal pops.

### Socks, Stockings and Pantyhose

The average price of socks with 2-3 days of wear is $20-$25. Extras were priced pretty much the same as panties. Most stockings and pantyhose listings were priced the same as socks.

### Vials of Fluid

Sellers often price per vial. An average small vial is [this size](http://www.amazon.com/Glass-Vials-Dram-Pack-12/dp/B002JV6976/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1413370427&sr=8-3&keywords=glass+vials). Larger containers of liquid are best to be stored in plastic containers like [these](http://www.amazon.com/Clear-Plastic-Jar-With-Lid/dp/B0026HHVS4/ref=sr_1_19?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1411297469&sr=1-19&keywords=containers+for+mixing+paint).

## Digital Items

### Photo Sets

These usually run $1-$3 per photo. Many sellers have a minimum order number (10 seems to be normal) and many have a discount for large orders (20-30 seems to be normal). Consider the quality of your photos and the amount of time spent shooting and editing when you price your photo sets.

### Custom Videos

Most sellers price based on content and length. Some sellers do a per minute pricing and others will do a base price for a set amount of time and then add a discounted per minute price. Normal per minute pricing ranges from $4-$10 per minute. $6 seems average.

For block pricing $50 for 5 minutes and $90 for 10 minutes (usually based on content) seems to be the average.

Sellers usually offer 2 different rates for custom content vs private content. If a buyer doesn't want a video to be resold, most sellers charge a fee for the sole ownership. This fee tends to range from $25-$200 extra.

### Premade Video

Premade videos are generally priced at $1-$2 per minute, or higher for fetish content.

### Cam Shows

Again this is a service that is also based on content and length. Most sellers set a per minute price and will have minimums however some sellers do have block pricing. Average cost per minute ranges from $3-$5. For block pricing, $60 for 15 minutes is average, or $100 for 30 minutes.

Sellers often upcharge for fetish shows that require more preparation or clean up.

### Kik Sexting

Kik is usually sold either per minute or in block prices. Many sellers have different prices for text only, showing face, or using props. Most sellers have a 10-15 minute minimum. The following prices reflect prices with pictures and videos:

* $2/minute
* 15 minutes average $30
* 30 minutes average $55
* 45 minutes average $75
* 60 minutes average $100

This service in particular can become very time consuming, don't undervalue your time and efforts. GFE usually requires more attention and sellers charge a higher fee for it.

### Snapchat Subscriptions

This is a photo subscription which seems to be the most popular. Sellers take 5 to 15 photos and videos per day and send each one to all their subscribers. This does not take into consideration people who use it like kik, for sexting, but we recommend using the kik pricing for that.

* Monthly averages $15-20
* 6-month prices average $50-70
* Yearly averages $100

### Girlfriend Experience (GFE)

This service can be very involved and time consuming! Be sure to charge accordingly! Many sellers have different options based on how much attention will be given, and if sexting sessions are included or not. Some sellers require a 1-3 days trial before longer can be purchased.

* One day: $50-75
* One week: $100-250
* One month (less common): $500-750

### Cock Ratings

Some sellers do text only, some do videos, which can be clothed or frequently have a higher price for nude videos. Many sellers have an option for videos sent over Kik or a more expensive, downloadable HD option.

* Text only: $10
* Video: Average ranges $20-$60, dependent on length and quality.

### Phone Sex

This is a service that may be based on content and length. Most sellers set a per minute price and will have minimums however some sellers do block pricing. Average cost $2-$5 per minute.

### Domination Tasks

These are one off tasks that do not include a lot of attention. They average at $20-$30 per task.

### Key Holding

* service that does not include a lot of attention - $25-$50 per week
* More involved service runs $100- $250 per week
